# Reader Module — Design Notes

## NOTE-001: Lazy Column Decode (Presence-First, On-Demand Full Decode)
*Added: 2026-03-05*

**Problem:** `ParseBlockFromBytes` with a `wantColumns` filter decoded only the predicate
columns eagerly, leaving all remaining columns absent from the block. Callers (executor)
had to issue a second pass via `AddColumnsToBlock` to decode those remaining columns eagerly
before the row loop — decoding ~90 columns per block even when only ~10-15 were accessed.

**Solution:** Replace the two-pass decode with a single-pass lazy model:
1. **Eager pass** — decode `wantColumns` fully (presence + values). Unchanged.
2. **Lazy registration** — for all other columns, call `decodePresenceOnly` (no zstd
   decompression) and store a `rawEncoding` sub-slice into the block's raw bytes. The
   `Column.Present` bitset is populated immediately; value data is deferred.
3. **On-demand full decode** — the first call to any value accessor (`StringValue`,
   `Uint64Value`, etc.) checks `rawEncoding != nil` and calls `decodeNow()`, which performs
   the full zstd decompression and populates all typed fields.

**`decodePresenceOnly` complexity:** O(M/8) where M is span count — scans past compressed
blob length prefixes to reach the uncompressed presence RLE. No zstd involved.

**`Column.IsPresent()` contract:** Always available after `ParseBlockFromBytes` without
triggering `decodeNow()`. Presence is decoded during lazy registration.

**Savings estimate (T9/Q66, 1997 blocks, ~90 non-predicate columns):**
- Old: 1997 × 90 × zstd_decompress ≈ 870ms
- New: 1997 × 90 × presence_only + 1997 × ~15 × zstd_decompress ≈ 40ms + 150ms = 190ms
- Expected saving: ~680ms per query

## NOTE-002: rawEncoding Lifetime Safety
*Added: 2026-03-05*

**Invariant:** `rawEncoding` is a sub-slice into `BlockWithBytes.RawBytes`. It is valid
for the lifetime of the owning `BlockWithBytes`. All lazy decodes (`decodeNow()`) complete
within the same block's row loop before `bwb` goes out of scope.

**internMap safety:** Each `ParseBlockFromBytes` and `AddColumnsToBlock` call creates its
own fresh `make(map[string]string)` intern map local to that call. Strings interned during
parsing and lazy decodes do not persist across calls. `ResetInternStrings()` is now a no-op
retained for call-site compatibility — callers still invoke it before each block, but it has
no effect. Cross-call intern reuse no longer occurs; this trade-off is accepted for
race-safety (per-call maps eliminate any shared-map data race between concurrent readers).

*Addendum (2026-03-17):* The original description (internMap borrowed from
`Reader.internStrings`, bounded by `ResetInternStrings`) reflected an earlier design that
was superseded when per-call intern maps were introduced for race-safety.

**Single-goroutine guarantee:** The scan path is single-goroutine. No locking is required
for `decodeNow()`.

## NOTE-003: objectcache Migration — GC-Cooperative Process-Level Caches
*Added: 2026-03-23*

**Problem:** The three `sync.Map` process-level caches in `parser.go` held strong
`*T` pointers, causing parsed file metadata (~45 MB per file after snappy decode),
sketch indexes, and decoded intrinsic columns to accumulate without bound. In Tempo
deployments scanning hundreds of blockpack files, these caches grew until OOM or
process restart. Additionally, the intrinsic TOC (`r.intrinsicIndex` map) had no
process-level cache at all — it was re-decoded from bbolt bytes on every
`NewReaderFromProvider` call even when the raw blob was already cached.

**Solution:** Replace all three `sync.Map` globals with `objectcache.Cache[T]`
instances (new `internal/modules/objectcache/` module). Add a fourth cache for
the intrinsic TOC. `objectcache.Cache[T]` stores `weak.Pointer[T]` values:

- GC may reclaim entries when no `*Reader` holds a strong reference (Go 1.24+
  `weak` package; go.mod declares `go 1.26.0`).
- Stale map keys are deleted lazily on `Get` (prevents key accumulation).
- `ClearCaches()` updated to call `.Clear()` on all four instances.

**`metadataBytes` safety:** `*Reader` copies `pm.metadataBytes` at construction,
establishing a strong ref chain `Reader → metadataBytes` independent of the cache.
Range index offsets sub-slice into this copied pointer, remaining valid for the
entire reader lifetime regardless of GC activity on the cache entry.

**Concurrent double-parse:** Two goroutines opening the same file simultaneously
may both miss the cache and both parse. The second `Put` overwrites with an
equivalent object (immutable data). This is the same race as the prior `sync.Map`
code. `filecache.GetOrFetch` deduplicates the underlying I/O via singleflight, so
at most one raw-bytes read occurs even if two parses run.

## NOTE-004: BUG-07 — compareRangeKey float64 NaN safety via cmp.Compare
*Added: 2026-03-23*

**Problem:** The `ColumnTypeRangeFloat64` branch of `compareRangeKey` used manual `<` / `>`
comparisons. IEEE 754 defines NaN as unordered: `NaN < x`, `NaN > x`, and `NaN == x` are
all false. Both branches failed for any NaN operand, causing the function to fall through to
`return 0` (equal). Binary search then placed NaN at an unpredictable position, corrupting
`BlocksForRange` / `BlocksForRangeInterval` results silently.

**Fix:** Replace manual comparisons with `cmp.Compare(va, vb)` (Go 1.21+). `cmp.Compare`
implements a stable total order: NaN is treated as less than any non-NaN value (including
`-Inf`). This matches the contract required by `slices.SortFunc` / `sort.Search` callers.

**Why cmp.Compare and not NaN guard:** A NaN guard (`if math.IsNaN → return 0`) would still
return 0 for `NaN vs NaN` (acceptable) but could return 0 for `NaN vs -Inf` (also NaN ==
-Inf, wrong). `cmp.Compare` gives a consistent total order without special-casing.

## NOTE-005: BUG-08 — decode*Key sentinel values for malformed short keys
*Added: 2026-03-23*

**Problem:** `decodeInt64Key`, `decodeUint64Key`, and `decodeFloat64Key` all returned `0`
for keys shorter than 8 bytes. Zero is a valid encoded value for all three types, so
malformed (short) keys were silently treated as valid zero-values. This corrupted binary
search comparisons in `compareRangeKey` and `BlocksForRange`/`BlocksForRangeInterval`.

**Fix:** Apply type-appropriate sentinels for short-key fallback:
- `decodeInt64Key`: return `math.MinInt64` — sorts below all valid int64 values.
- `decodeUint64Key`: return `0` — already the minimum uint64 sentinel; no change needed.
- `decodeFloat64Key`: return `math.NaN()` — `cmp.Compare` (NOTE-004/BUG-07) treats NaN as
  less than any non-NaN, giving a consistent total order without corrupting search.

**Shared helper:** `readLE8(key string) (uint64, bool)` extracts the 8-byte LE uint64 and
returns `false` for short keys. Each decode function applies its own sentinel on `!ok`.
