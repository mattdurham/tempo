// STRUCTURE:
//   1. Header: Metadata about generation
//   2. Index: Function lookup table (number -> function details)
//   3. Graph: Call edges between functions
//   4. Statistics: Summary metrics
//
// GRAMMAR:
//   A -> B       Function A calls function B
//   A -> A*      Function A is recursive (calls itself)
//   A -> B -> A* Functions A and B are mutually recursive
//
// INDEX FORMAT:
//   {index}: {file}:{line} - {function_name} [RECURSIVE]
//      └─ {comment}
//
//   - index: Unique integer identifier for the function
//   - file:line: Source location (filename and line number)
//   - function_name: Fully qualified function name
//   - [RECURSIVE]: Optional marker for self-recursive functions
//   - comment: Optional documentation from source code
//
// GRAPH FORMAT:
//   {caller_index} -> {callee_index}[*]
//
//   - Regular call: "0 -> 1" (function 0 calls function 1)

//   ## Graph
//
//   0 -> 1      # main calls auth.Login
//   1 -> 2      # auth.Login calls db.Query

0: api.go:54 - blockpack.NewReader
   └─ NewReader creates a reader from raw bytes.
1: reader.go:102 - blockio.NewReader
   └─ BOT: Get rid of this. NewReader parses blockpack data (v5 format) from an in-memory buffer.
2: reader.go:108 - blockio.NewReaderFromProvider
   └─ NewReaderFromProvider parses blockpack data (v5 format) from a provider. BOT: Get rid of this.
3: reader.go:117 - blockio.NewReaderWithCache
   └─ NewReaderWithCache parses blockpack data from a provider with optional caching. The name parameter is used for cache keys and must uniquely identify the file. If name is empty, caching will be disabled even if a cache is provided. The cache parameter is optional (pass nil for no caching). We should NOT have a separate byte cache, instead use a layered reader provider.
4: reader_providers.go:34 - (*github.com/mattdurham/blockpack/internal/executor.fileReaderProvider).Size
5: reader.go:222 - (*github.com/mattdurham/blockpack/internal/blockio.byteSliceProvider).Size
6: errors.go:22 - fmt.Errorf
   └─ Errorf formats according to a format specifier and returns the string as a value that satisfies error. If the format specifier includes a %w verb with an error operand, the returned error will implement an Unwrap method returning the operand. If there is more than one %w verb, the returned error will implement an Unwrap method returning a []error containing all the %w operands in the order they appear in the arguments. It is invalid to supply the %w verb with an operand that does not implement the error interface. The %w verb is otherwise a synonym for %v.
7: print.go:151 - fmt.newPrinter
   └─ newPrinter allocates a new pp struct or grabs a cached one.
8: pool.go:131 - (*sync.Pool).Get
   └─ Get selects an arbitrary item from the [Pool], removes it from the Pool, and returns it to the caller. Get may choose to ignore the pool and treat it as empty. Callers should not assume any relation between values passed to [Pool.Put] and the values returned by Get. If Get would otherwise return nil and p.New is non-nil, Get returns the result of calling p.New.
9: norace.go:25 - race.Disable
10: pool.go:202 - (*sync.Pool).pin
   └─ pin pins the current goroutine to P, disables preemption and returns poolLocal pool for the P and the P's id. Caller must call runtime_procUnpin() when done with the pool.
11: pool.go:307 - sync.runtime_procPin
12: pool.go:315 - sync.runtime_LoadAcquintptr
   └─ go:linkname runtime_LoadAcquintptr internal/runtime/atomic.LoadAcquintptr
13: pool.go:300 - sync.indexLocal
14: pool.go:223 - (*sync.Pool).pinSlow
15: pool.go:308 - sync.runtime_procUnpin
16: mutex.go:45 - (*sync.Mutex).Lock
   └─ Lock locks m. If the lock is already in use, the calling goroutine blocks until the mutex is available.
17: mutex.go:61 - (*internal/sync.Mutex).Lock
   └─ Lock locks m. See package [sync.Mutex] documentation.
18: doc.go:93 - atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32
   └─ CompareAndSwapInt32 executes the compare-and-swap operation for an int32 value. Consider using the more ergonomic and less error-prone [Int32.CompareAndSwap] instead. go:noescape
19: mutex.go:95 - (*internal/sync.Mutex).lockSlow
20: runtime.go:38 - sync.runtime_canSpin
   └─ Active spinning runtime support. runtime_canSpin reports whether spinning makes sense at the moment. go:linkname runtime_canSpin
21: runtime.go:43 - sync.runtime_doSpin
   └─ runtime_doSpin does active spinning. go:linkname runtime_doSpin
22: runtime.go:49 - sync.throw
   └─ go:linkname throw
23: runtime.go:46 - sync.runtime_nanotime
   └─ go:linkname runtime_nanotime
24: runtime.go:21 - sync.runtime_SemacquireMutex
   └─ SemacquireMutex is like Semacquire, but for profiling contended Mutexes and RWMutexes. If lifo is true, queue waiter at the head of wait queue. skipframes is the number of frames to omit during tracing, counting from runtime_SemacquireMutex's caller. The different forms of this function just tell the runtime how to present the reason for waiting in a backtrace, and is used to compute some metrics. Otherwise they're functionally identical. go:linkname runtime_SemacquireMutex
25: doc.go:115 - atomic.AddInt32
   └─ AddInt32 atomically adds delta to *addr and returns the new value. Consider using the more ergonomic and less error-prone [Int32.Add] instead. go:noescape
26: norace.go:16 - race.Acquire
27: mutex.go:64 - (*sync.Mutex).Unlock
   └─ Unlock unlocks m. It is a run-time error if m is not locked on entry to Unlock. A locked [Mutex] is not associated with a particular goroutine. It is allowed for one goroutine to lock a Mutex and then arrange for another goroutine to unlock it.
28: mutex.go:187 - (*internal/sync.Mutex).Unlock
   └─ Unlock unlocks m. See package [sync.Mutex] documentation.
29: norace.go:19 - race.Release
30: mutex.go:202 - (*internal/sync.Mutex).unlockSlow
31: runtime.go:52 - sync.fatal
   └─ go:linkname fatal
32: runtime.go:32 - sync.runtime_Semrelease
   └─ Semrelease atomically increments *s and notifies a waiting goroutine if one is blocked in Semacquire. It is intended as a simple wakeup primitive for use by the synchronization library and should not be used directly. If handoff is true, pass count directly to the first waiter. skipframes is the number of frames to omit during tracing, counting from runtime_Semrelease's caller. go:linkname runtime_Semrelease
33: debug.go:70 - runtime.GOMAXPROCS
   └─ GOMAXPROCS sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously and returns the previous setting. If n < 1, it does not change the current setting. # Default If the GOMAXPROCS environment variable is set to a positive whole number, GOMAXPROCS defaults to that value. Otherwise, the Go runtime selects an appropriate default value from a combination of - the number of logical CPUs on the machine, - the process’s CPU affinity mask, - and, on Linux, the process’s average CPU throughput limit based on cgroup CPU quota, if any. If GODEBUG=containermaxprocs=0 is set and GOMAXPROCS is not set by the environment variable, then GOMAXPROCS instead defaults to the value of [runtime.NumCPU]. Note that GODEBUG=containermaxprocs=0 is [default] for language version 1.24 and below. # Updates The Go runtime periodically updates the default value based on changes to the total logical CPU count, the CPU affinity mask, or cgroup quota. Setting a custom value with the GOMAXPROCS environment variable or by calling GOMAXPROCS disables automatic updates. The default value and automatic updates can be restored by calling [SetDefaultGOMAXPROCS]. If GODEBUG=updatemaxprocs=0 is set, the Go runtime does not perform automatic GOMAXPROCS updating. Note that GODEBUG=updatemaxprocs=0 is [default] for language version 1.24 and below. # Compatibility Note that the default GOMAXPROCS behavior may change as the scheduler improves, especially the implementation detail below. # Implementation details When computing default GOMAXPROCS via cgroups, the Go runtime computes the "average CPU throughput limit" as the cgroup CPU quota / period. In cgroup v2, these values come from the cpu.max file. In cgroup v1, they come from cpu.cfs_quota_us and cpu.cfs_period_us, respectively. In container runtimes that allow configuring CPU limits, this value usually corresponds to the "CPU limit" option, not "CPU request". The Go runtime typically selects the default GOMAXPROCS as the minimum of the logical CPU count, the CPU affinity mask count, or the cgroup CPU throughput limit. However, it will never set GOMAXPROCS less than 2 unless the logical CPU count or CPU affinity mask count are below 2. If the cgroup CPU throughput limit is not a whole number, the Go runtime rounds up to the next whole number. GOMAXPROCS updates are performed up to once per second, or less if the application is idle. [default]: https://go.dev/doc/godebug#default
34: lock_spinbit.go:151 - runtime.lock
35: lockrank_off.go:19 - runtime.getLockRank
36: lockrank_off.go:23 - runtime.lockWithRank
37: lock_spinbit.go:155 - runtime.lock2
38: stubs.go:31 - runtime.getg
   └─ getg returns the pointer to the current g. The compiler rewrites calls to this function into instructions that fetch the g directly (from TLS or from the dedicated register).
39: panic.go:1085 - runtime.throw
   └─ throw triggers a fatal error that dumps a stack trace and exits. throw should be used for runtime-internal fatal errors where Go itself, rather than user code, may be at fault for the failure. throw should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/sonic - github.com/cockroachdb/pebble - github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto - github.com/outcaste-io/ristretto - github.com/pingcap/br - gvisor.dev/gvisor - github.com/sagernet/gvisor Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname throw go:nosplit
40: stubs.go:67 - runtime.systemstack
   └─ systemstack runs fn on a system stack. If systemstack is called from the per-OS-thread (g0) stack, or if systemstack is called from the signal handling (gsignal) stack, systemstack calls fn directly and returns. Otherwise, systemstack is being called from the limited stack of an ordinary goroutine. In this case, systemstack switches to the per-OS-thread stack, calls fn, and switches back. It is common to use a func literal as the argument, in order to share inputs and outputs with the code around the call to system stack: ... set up y ... systemstack(func() { x = bigcall(y) }) ... use x ... go:noescape
41: panic.go:1262 - runtime.fatalthrow
   └─ fatalthrow implements an unrecoverable runtime throw. It freezes the system, prints stack traces starting from its caller, and terminates the process. go:nosplit
42: intrinsics.go:233 - sys.GetCallerPC
43: intrinsics.go:235 - sys.GetCallerSP
44: lock_spinbit.go:74 - runtime.key8
   └─ go:nosplit
45: atomic_amd64.go:61 - atomic.Xchg8
   └─ go:noescape
46: lock_futex.go:136 - runtime.semacreate
   └─ go:nosplit
47: atomic_amd64.go:82 - atomic.Or8
   └─ go:noescape
48: stubs.go:36 - atomic.Loaduintptr
   └─ go:noescape
49: stubs.go:24 - atomic.Casuintptr
   └─ go:noescape
50: mprof.go:667 - (*runtime.mLockProfile).end
51: time_nofake.go:32 - runtime.nanotime
   └─ Exported via linkname for use by time and internal/poll. Many external packages also linkname nanotime for a fast monotonic time. Such code should be updated to use: var start = time.Now() // at init time and then replace nanotime() with time.Since(start), which is equally fast. However, all the code linknaming nanotime is never going to go away. Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname nanotime go:nosplit
52: stubs3.go:10 - runtime.nanotime1
   └─ go:wasmimport gojs runtime.nanotime1
53: types.go:108 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Int64).Add
   └─ Add adds delta to i atomically, returning the new updated value. This operation wraps around in the usual two's-complement way. go:nosplit
54: stubs.go:53 - atomic.Xaddint64
   └─ go:noescape
55: lock_spinbit.go:134 - runtime.mutexPreferLowLatency
   └─ mutexPreferLowLatency reports if this mutex prefers low latency at the risk of performance collapse. If so, we can allow all waiting threads to spin on the state word rather than go to sleep. TODO: We could have the waiting Ms each spin on their own private cache line, especially if we can put a bound on the on-CPU time that would consume. TODO: If there's a small set of mutex values with special requirements, they could make use of a more specialized lock2/unlock2 implementation. Otherwise, we're constrained to what we can fit within a single uintptr with no additional storage on the M for each lock held. go:nosplit
56: stubs.go:277 - runtime.procyield
   └─ procyield should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/sagernet/sing-tun - github.com/slackhq/nebula - golang.zx2c4.com/wireguard Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname procyield
57: os_linux.go:462 - runtime.osyield
58: cputicks.go:11 - runtime.cputicks
   └─ careful: cputicks is not guaranteed to be monotonic! In particular, we have noticed drift between cpus on certain os/arch combinations. See issue 8976.
59: mprof.go:660 - (*runtime.mLockProfile).start
60: rand.go:291 - runtime.cheaprandn
   └─ cheaprandn is like cheaprand() % n but faster. cheaprandn must not be exported to other packages: the rule is that other packages using runtime-provided randomness must always use randn. cheaprandn should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/phuslu/log Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname cheaprandn go:nosplit
61: rand.go:227 - runtime.cheaprand
   └─ cheaprand is a non-cryptographic-quality 32-bit random generator suitable for calling at very high frequency (such as during scheduling decisions) and at sensitive moments in the runtime (such as during stack unwinding). it is "cheap" in the sense of both expense and quality. cheaprand must not be exported to other packages: the rule is that other packages using runtime-provided randomness must always use rand. cheaprand should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/gopkg Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname cheaprand go:nosplit
62: math.go:32 - math.Mul64
   └─ Mul64 returns the 128-bit product of x and y: (hi, lo) = x * y with the product bits' upper half returned in hi and the lower half returned in lo. This is a copy from math/bits.Mul64 On supported platforms this is an intrinsic lowered by the compiler.
63: lock_spinbit.go:111 - runtime.mutexWaitListHead
   └─ mutexWaitListHead recovers a full muintptr that was missing its low bits. With the exception of the static m0 value, it requires allocating runtime.m values in a size class with a particular minimum alignment. The 2048-byte size class allows recovering the full muintptr value even after overwriting the low 11 bits with flags. We can use those 11 bits as 3 flags and an atomically-swapped byte. go:nosplit
64: lock_futex.go:139 - runtime.semasleep
   └─ go:nosplit
65: atomic_amd64.go:52 - atomic.Xadd
   └─ go:noescape
66: os_linux.go:69 - runtime.futexsleep
   └─ Atomically, if(*addr == val) sleep Might be woken up spuriously; that's allowed. Don't sleep longer than ns; ns < 0 means forever. go:nosplit
67: os_linux.go:44 - runtime.futex
   └─ go:noescape
68: defs_linux_amd64.go:103 - (*runtime.timespec).setNsec
   └─ go:nosplit
69: atomic_amd64.go:17 - atomic.Load
   └─ go:nosplit go:noinline
70: lock_spinbit.go:260 - runtime.unlock
71: lockrank_off.go:34 - runtime.unlockWithRank
72: lock_spinbit.go:267 - runtime.unlock2
   └─ We might not be holding a p in this code. go:nowritebarrier
73: lock_spinbit.go:329 - runtime.mutexSampleContention
   └─ mutexSampleContention returns whether the current mutex operation should report any contention it discovers.
74: atomic_amd64.go:29 - atomic.Load64
   └─ go:nosplit go:noinline
75: lock_spinbit.go:345 - runtime.unlock2Wake
   └─ unlock2Wake updates the list of Ms waiting on l, waking an M if necessary. go:nowritebarrier
76: runtime2.go:283 - (runtime.muintptr).ptr
   └─ go:nosplit
77: mprof.go:679 - (*runtime.mLockProfile).recordUnlock
   └─ recordUnlock prepares data for later addition to the mutex contention profile. The M may hold arbitrary locks during this call. From unlock2, we might not be holding a p in this code. go:nowritebarrierrec
78: mprof.go:712 - (*runtime.mLockProfile).captureStack
79: rand.go:271 - runtime.cheaprand64
   └─ cheaprand64 is a non-cryptographic-quality 63-bit random generator suitable for calling at very high frequency (such as during sampling decisions). it is "cheap" in the sense of both expense and quality. cheaprand64 must not be exported to other packages: the rule is that other packages using runtime-provided randomness must always use rand. cheaprand64 should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/zhangyunhao116/fastrand Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname cheaprand64 go:nosplit
80: lock_futex.go:158 - runtime.semawakeup
   └─ go:nosplit
81: os_linux.go:88 - runtime.futexwakeup
   └─ If any procs are sleeping on addr, wake up at most cnt. go:nosplit
82: mprof.go:755 - (*runtime.mLockProfile).store
   └─ store adds the M's local record to the mutex contention profile. From unlock2, we might not be holding a p in this code. go:nowritebarrierrec
83: mprof.go:761 - (*runtime.mLockProfile).storeSlow
84: runtime1.go:629 - runtime.acquirem
   └─ go:nosplit
85: mprof.go:795 - runtime.saveBlockEventStack
86: mprof.go:275 - runtime.stkbucket
   └─ Return the bucket for stk[0:nstk], allocating new bucket if needed.
87: types.go:465 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.UnsafePointer).Load
   └─ Load accesses and returns the value atomically. go:nosplit
88: atomic_amd64.go:23 - atomic.Loadp
   └─ go:nosplit go:noinline
89: mem.go:49 - runtime.sysAlloc
   └─ sysAlloc transitions an OS-chosen region of memory from None to Ready. More specifically, it obtains a large chunk of zeroed memory from the operating system, typically on the order of a hundred kilobytes or a megabyte. This memory is always immediately available for use. sysStat must be non-nil. Don't split the stack as this function may be invoked without a valid G, which prevents us from allocating more stack. go:nosplit
90: mstats.go:659 - (*runtime.sysMemStat).add
   └─ add atomically adds the sysMemStat by n. Must be nosplit as it is called in runtime initialization, e.g. newosproc0. go:nosplit
91: atomic_amd64.go:55 - atomic.Xadd64
   └─ go:noescape
92: types.go:343 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uint64).Add
   └─ Add adds delta to u atomically, returning the new updated value. This operation wraps around in the usual two's-complement way. go:nosplit
93: mem_linux.go:21 - runtime.sysAllocOS
   └─ Don't split the stack as this method may be invoked without a valid G, which prevents us from allocating more stack. go:nosplit
94: cgo_mmap.go:31 - runtime.mmap
   └─ mmap is used to route the mmap system call through C code when using cgo, to support sanitizer interceptors. Don't allow stack splits, since this function (used by sysAlloc) is called in a lot of low-level parts of the runtime and callers often assume it won't acquire any locks. go:nosplit
95: cgo_mmap.go:59 - runtime.sysMmap
   └─ sysMmap calls the mmap system call. It is implemented in assembly.
96: set_vma_name_linux.go:18 - runtime.setVMAName
   └─ setVMAName calls prctl(PR_SET_VMA, PR_SET_VMA_ANON_NAME, start, len, name)
97: syscall_linux.go:17 - syscall.Syscall6
   └─ Syscall6 calls system call number 'num' with arguments a1-6.
98: types.go:167 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Bool).Load
   └─ Load accesses and returns the value atomically. go:nosplit
99: types.go:123 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uint8).Load
   └─ Load accesses and returns the value atomically. go:nosplit
100: atomic_amd64.go:74 - atomic.Load8
   └─ go:nosplit go:noinline
101: types.go:174 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Bool).Store
   └─ Store updates the value atomically. go:nosplit
102: types.go:130 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uint8).Store
   └─ Store updates the value atomically. go:nosplit
103: atomic_amd64.go:120 - atomic.Store8
   └─ go:noescape
104: stubs2.go:20 - runtime.exit
105: asan0.go:25 - runtime.lsanregisterrootregion
106: types.go:478 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.UnsafePointer).StoreNoWB
   └─ StoreNoWB updates the value atomically. WARNING: As the name implies this operation does *not* perform a write barrier on value, and so this operation may hide pointers from the GC. Use with care and sparingly. It is safe to use with values not found in the Go heap. Prefer Store instead. go:nosplit
107: atomic_amd64.go:138 - atomic.StorepNoWB
   └─ StorepNoWB performs *ptr = val atomically and without a write barrier. NO go:noescape annotation; see atomic_pointer.go.
108: mprof.go:247 - (*runtime.bucket).stk
   └─ stk returns the slice in b holding the stack. The caller can assume that the backing array is immutable.
109: stubs.go:24 - runtime.add
   └─ Should be a built-in for unsafe.Pointer? add should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - fortio.org/log Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname add go:nosplit
110: mprof.go:352 - runtime.eqslice
111: mprof.go:228 - runtime.newBucket
   └─ newBucket allocates a bucket with the given type and number of stack entries.
112: malloc.go:1919 - runtime.persistentalloc
   └─ Wrapper around sysAlloc that can allocate small chunks. There is no associated free operation. Intended for things like function/type/debug-related persistent data. If align is 0, uses default align (currently 8). The returned memory will be zeroed. sysStat must be non-nil. Consider marking persistentalloc'd types not in heap by embedding internal/runtime/sys.NotInHeap. nosplit because it is used during write barriers and must not be preempted. go:nosplit
113: mprof.go:266 - (*runtime.bucket).bp
   └─ bp returns the blockRecord associated with the blockProfile bucket b.
114: funcpc.go:31 - abi.FuncPCABIInternal
   └─ FuncPCABIInternal returns the entry PC of the function f. If f is a direct reference of a function, it must be defined as ABIInternal. Otherwise it is a compile-time error. If f is not a direct reference of a defined function, it assumes that f is a func value. Otherwise the behavior is undefined. Implemented as a compile intrinsic.
115: runtime1.go:636 - runtime.releasem
   └─ go:nosplit
116: proc.go:1547 - runtime.stopTheWorldGC
   └─ stopTheWorldGC has the same effect as stopTheWorld, but blocks until the GC is not running. It also blocks a GC from starting until startTheWorldGC is called.
117: sema.go:142 - runtime.semacquire
   └─ Called from runtime.
118: sema.go:146 - runtime.semacquire1
119: sema.go:291 - runtime.cansemacquire
120: stubs.go:12 - atomic.Cas

   └─ go:nosplit
123: sema.go:56 - (*runtime.semTable).rootFor
124: types.go:290 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uint32).Add
   └─ Add adds delta to u atomically, returning the new updated value. This operation wraps around in the usual two's-complement way. go:nosplit
125: sema.go:304 - (*runtime.semaRoot).queue

   └─ rotateLeft rotates the tree rooted at node x. turning (x a (y b c)) into (y (x a b) c).
128: proc.go:465 - runtime.goparkunlock
   └─ Puts the current goroutine into a waiting state and unlocks the lock. The goroutine can be made runnable again by calling goready(gp).
129: proc.go:443 - runtime.gopark
   └─ Puts the current goroutine into a waiting state and calls unlockf on the system stack. If unlockf returns false, the goroutine is resumed. unlockf must not access this G's stack, as it may be moved between the call to gopark and the call to unlockf. Note that because unlockf is called after putting the G into a waiting state, the G may have already been readied by the time unlockf is called unless there is external synchronization preventing the G from being readied. If unlockf returns false, it must guarantee that the G cannot be externally readied. Reason explains why the goroutine has been parked. It is displayed in stack traces and heap dumps. Reasons should be unique and descriptive. Do not re-use reasons, add new ones. gopark should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname.

   └─ Load accesses and returns the value atomically. go:nosplit
133: stubs.go:47 - runtime.mcall
   └─ mcall switches from the g to the g0 stack and invokes fn(g), where g is the goroutine that made the call. mcall saves g's current PC/SP in g->sched so that it can be restored later. It is up to fn to arrange for that later execution, typically by recording g in a data structure, causing something to call ready(g) later. mcall returns to the original goroutine g later, when g has been rescheduled. fn must not return at all; typically it ends by calling schedule, to let the m run other goroutines. mcall can only be called from g stacks (not g0, not gsignal). This must NOT be go:noescape: if fn is a stack-allocated closure, fn puts g on a run queue, and g executes before fn returns, the closure will be invalidated while it is still executing.
134: mprof.go:506 - runtime.blockevent
135: mprof.go:519 - runtime.blocksampled
   └─ blocksampled returns true for all events where cycles >= rate. Shorter events have a cycles/rate random chance of returning true.
136: mprof.go:533 - runtime.saveblockevent
   └─ saveblockevent records a profile event of the type specified by which. cycles is the quantity associated with this event and rate is the sampling rate, used to adjust the cycles value in the manner determined by the profile type. skip is the number of frames to omit from the traceback associated with the event. The traceback will be recorded from the stack of the goroutine associated with the current m. skip should be positive if this event is recorded from the current stack (e.g. when this is not called from a system stack)
137: tracestack.go:256 - runtime.tracefpunwindoff

146: panic.go:1106 - runtime.fatal
   └─ fatal triggers a fatal error that dumps a stack trace and exits. fatal is equivalent to throw, but is used when user code is expected to be at fault for the failure, such as racing map writes. fatal does not include runtime frames, system goroutines, or frame metadata (fp, sp, pc) in the stack trace unless GOTRACEBACK=system or higher. go:nosplit

152: print.go:268 - runtime.hexdumpWords
   └─ hexdumpWords prints a word-oriented hex dump of [p, end). If mark != nil, it will be called with each printed word's address and should return a character mark to appear just before that word's value. It can return 0 to indicate no mark.
153: print.go:85 - runtime.gwrite
   └─ write to goroutine-local buffer if diverting output, or else standard error.
154: print.go:39 - runtime.recordForPanic
   └─ recordForPanic maintains a circular buffer of messages written by the runtime leading up to a process crash, allowing the messages to be extracted from a core dump. The text written during a process crash (following "panic" or "fatal error") is not saved, since the goroutine stacks will generally be readable from the runtime data structures in the core file.

167: symtab.go:688 - (*runtime.moduledata).textAddr
   └─ textAddr returns md.text + off, with special handling for multiple text sections. off is a (virtual) offset computed at internal linking time, before the external linker adjusts the sections' base addresses. The text, or instruction stream is generated as one large buffer. The off (offset) for a function is its offset within this buffer. If the total text size gets too large, there can be issues on platforms like ppc64 if the target of calls are too far for the call instruction. To resolve the large text issue, the text is split into multiple text sections to allow the linker to generate long calls when necessary. When this happens, the vaddr for each text section is set to its offset within the text. Each function's offset is compared against the section vaddrs and ends to determine the containing section. Then the section relative offset is added to the section's relocated baseaddr to compute the function address. It is nosplit because it is part of the findfunc implementation. go:nosplit

172: mheap.go:700 - runtime.spanOf
   └─ spanOf returns the span of p. If p does not point into the heap arena or no span has ever contained p, spanOf returns nil. If p does not point to allocated memory, this may return a non-nil span that does *not* contain p. If this is a possibility, the caller should either call spanOfHeap or check the span bounds explicitly. Must be nosplit because it has callers that are nosplit. go:nosplit
173: mheap.go:619 - runtime.arenaIndex
   └─ arenaIndex returns the index into mheap_.arenas of the arena containing metadata for p. This index combines of an index into the L1 map and an index into the L2 map and should be used as mheap_.arenas[ai.l1()][ai.l2()]. If p is outside the range of valid heap addresses, either l1() or l2() will be out of bounds. It is nosplit because it's called by spanOf and several other nosplit functions. go:nosplit
174: mheap.go:653 - (runtime.arenaIdx).l2
   └─ l2 returns the "l2" portion of an arenaIdx. Marked nosplit because it's called by spanOf and other nosplit funcs. functions. go:nosplit

179: mbitmap.go:1189 - (*runtime.mspan).divideByElemSize
   └─ divideByElemSize returns n/s.elemsize. n must be within [0, s.npages*_PageSize), or may be exactly s.npages*_PageSize if s.elemsize is from sizeclasses.go. nosplit, because it is called by objIndex, which is nosplit go:nosplit
180: mbitmap.go:1173 - (*runtime.mspan).isFreeOrNewlyAllocated
   └─ isFreeOrNewlyAllocated reports whether the index'th object in s is either unallocated or has been allocated since the beginning of the last mark phase. The caller must ensure s.state is mSpanInUse, and there must have been no preemption points since ensuring this (which could allow a GC transition, which would allow the state to change). Callers must ensure that the index passed here must not have been produced from a pointer that came from 'thin air', as might happen with conservative scanning, unless the GC is currently in the mark phase. If the GC is currently in the mark phase, this function is safe to call for out-of-thin-air pointers.
181: mheap.go:2875 - (*runtime.gcBits).bitp
   └─ bitp returns a pointer to the byte containing bit n and a mask for selecting that bit from *bytep.

   └─ bytep returns a pointer to the n'th byte of b.
183: traceback.go:252 - (*runtime.unwinder).resolveInternal
   └─ resolveInternal fills in u.frame based on u.frame.fn, pc, and sp. innermost indicates that this is the first resolve on this stack. If innermost is set, isSyscall indicates that the PC/SP was retrieved from gp.syscall*; this is otherwise ignored. On entry, u.frame contains: - fn is the running function. - pc is the PC in the running function. - sp is the stack pointer at that program counter. - For the innermost frame on LR machines, lr is the program counter that called fn. On return, u.frame contains: - fp is the stack pointer of the caller. - lr is the program counter that called fn. - varp, argp, and continpc are populated for the current frame. If fn is a stack-jumping function, resolveInternal can change the entire frame state to follow that stack jump. This is internal to unwinder.

192: traceback.go:620 - runtime.tracebackPCs
   └─ tracebackPCs populates pcBuf with the return addresses for each frame from u and returns the number of PCs written to pcBuf. The returned PCs correspond to "logical frames" rather than "physical frames"; that is if A is inlined into B, this will still return a PCs for both A and B. This also includes PCs generated by the cgo unwinder, if one is registered. If skip != 0, this skips this many logical frames. Callers should set the unwindSilentErrors flag on u.
193: traceback.go:593 - (*runtime.unwinder).cgoCallers
   └─ cgoCallers populates pcBuf with the cgo callers of the current frame using the registered cgo unwinder. It returns the number of PCs written to pcBuf. If the current frame is not a cgo frame or if there's no registered cgo unwinder, it returns 0.

   └─ getfp returns the frame pointer register of its caller or 0 if not implemented. TODO: Make this a compiler intrinsic
202: proc.go:4560 - runtime.reentersyscall
   └─ The goroutine g is about to enter a system call. Record that it's not using the cpu anymore. This is called only from the go syscall library and cgocall, not from the low-level system calls used by the runtime. Entersyscall cannot split the stack: the save must make g->sched refer to the caller's stack segment, because entersyscall is going to return immediately after. Nothing entersyscall calls can split the stack either. We cannot safely move the stack during an active call to syscall, because we do not know which of the uintptr arguments are really pointers (back into the stack). In practice, this means that we make the fast path run through entersyscall doing no-split things, and the slow path has to use systemstack to run bigger things on the system stack. reentersyscall is the entry point used by cgo callbacks, where explicitly saved SP and PC are restored. This is needed when exitsyscall will be called from a function further up in the call stack than the parent, as g->syscallsp must always point to a valid stack frame. entersyscall below is the normal entry point for syscalls, which obtains the SP and PC from the caller. go:nosplit

233: strings.go:16 - stringslite.HasPrefix
234: race0.go:30 - runtime.raceacquire
235: mfinal.go:575 - runtime.KeepAlive
   └─ KeepAlive marks its argument as currently reachable. This ensures that the object is not freed, and its finalizer is not run, before the point in the program where KeepAlive is called. A very simplified example showing where KeepAlive is required: type File struct { d int } d, err := syscall.Open("/file/path", syscall.O_RDONLY, 0) // ... do something if err != nil ... p := &File{d} runtime.SetFinalizer(p, func(p *File) { syscall.Close(p.d) }) var buf [10]byte n, err := syscall.Read(p.d, buf[:]) // Ensure p is not finalized until Read returns. runtime.KeepAlive(p) // No more uses of p after this point. Without the KeepAlive call, the finalizer could run at the start of [syscall.Read], closing the file descriptor before syscall.Read makes the actual system call. Note: KeepAlive should only be used to prevent finalizers from running prematurely. In particular, when used with [unsafe.Pointer], the rules for valid uses of unsafe.Pointer still apply.
236: traceback.go:580 - (*runtime.unwinder).symPC
   └─ symPC returns the PC that should be used for symbolizing the current frame. Specifically, this is the PC of the last instruction executed in this frame. If this frame did a normal call, then frame.pc is a return PC, so this will return frame.pc-1, which points into the CALL instruction. If the frame was interrupted by a signal (e.g., profiler, segv, etc) then frame.pc is for the trapped instruction, so this returns frame.pc. See issue #34123. Finally, frame.pc can be at function entry when the frame is initialized without actually running code, like in runtime.mstart, in which case this returns frame.pc because that's the best we can do.

   └─ fpTracebackPartialExpand records a call stack obtained starting from fp. This function will skip the given number of frames, properly accounting for inlining, and save remaining frames as "physical" return addresses. The consumer should later use CallersFrames or similar to expand inline frames.

252: proc.go:524 - runtime.releaseSudog
   └─ go:nosplit
253: proc.go:1507 - runtime.stopTheWorld
   └─ stopTheWorld stops all P's from executing goroutines, interrupting all goroutines at GC safe points and records reason as the reason for the stop. On return, only the current goroutine's P is running. stopTheWorld must not be called from a system stack and the caller must not hold worldsema. The caller must call startTheWorld when other P's should resume execution. stopTheWorld is safe for multiple goroutines to call at the same time. Each will execute its own stop, and the stops will be serialized. This is also used by routines that do stack dumps. If the system is in panic or being exited, this may not reliably stop all goroutines. Returns the STW context. When starting the world, this context must be passed to startTheWorld.

   └─ argNumber returns the next argument to evaluate, which is either the value of the passed-in argNum or the value of the bracketed integer that begins format[i:]. It also returns the new value of i, that is, the index of the next byte of the format to process.
288: print.go:972 - fmt.parseArgNumber
   └─ parseArgNumber returns the value of the bracketed number, minus 1 (explicit argument numbers are one-indexed but we want zero-indexed). The opening bracket is known to be present at format[0]. The returned values are the index, the number of bytes to consume up to the closing paren, if present, and whether the number parsed ok. The bytes to consume will be 1 if no closing paren is present.

301: type.go:178 - abi.TypeOf
   └─ TypeOf returns the abi.Type of some value.
302: escape.go:19 - abi.NoEscape
   └─ NoEscape hides the pointer p from escape analysis, preventing it from escaping to the heap. It compiles down to nothing. WARNING: This is very subtle to use correctly. The caller must ensure that it's truly safe for p to not escape to the heap by maintaining runtime pointer invariants (for example, that globals and the heap may not generally point into a stack). go:nosplit go:nocheckptr
303: type.go:2734 - reflect.toType
   └─ toType converts from a *rtype to a Type that can be returned to the client of package reflect. In gc, the only concern is that a nil *rtype must be replaced by a nil Type, but in gccgo this function takes care of ensuring that multiple *rtype for the same type are coalesced into a single Type. toType should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname.

308: type.go:661 - (internal/abi.Name).Name
   └─ Name returns the tag string for n, or empty if there is none.
309: type.go:625 - (internal/abi.Name).ReadVarint
   └─ ReadVarint parses a varint as encoded by encoding/binary. It returns the number of encoded bytes and the encoded value.
310: type.go:598 - (internal/abi.Name).DataChecked
   └─ DataChecked does pointer arithmetic on n's Bytes, and that arithmetic is asserted to be safe for the reason in whySafe (which can appear in a backtrace, etc.)
311: type.go:260 - abi.addChecked
   └─ addChecked returns p+x. The whySafe string is ignored, so that the function still inlines as efficiently as p+x, but all call sites should use the string to record why the addition is safe, which is to say why the addition does not cause x to advance to the very end of p's allocation and therefore point incorrectly at the next block in memory.

323: print.go:766 - (*fmt.pp).printValue [RECURSIVE]
   └─ printValue is similar to printArg but starts with a reflect value, not an interface{} value. It does not handle 'p' and 'T' verbs because these should have been already handled by printArg.
324: value.go:1472 - (reflect.Value).Interface
   └─ Interface returns v's current value as an interface{}. It is equivalent to: var i interface{} = (v's underlying value) It panics if the Value was obtained by accessing unexported struct fields.
325: value.go:1476 - reflect.valueInterface
326: makefunc.go:96 - reflect.makeMethodValue
   └─ makeMethodValue converts v from the rcvr+method index representation of a method value to an actual method func value, which is basically the receiver value with a special bit set, into a true func value - a value holding an actual func. The output is semantically equivalent to the input as far as the user of package reflect can tell, but the true func representation can be handled by code like Convert and Interface and Assign.
327: makefunc.go:132 - reflect.methodValueCallCodePtr
328: funcpc.go:22 - abi.FuncPCABI0
   └─ FuncPCABI0 returns the entry PC of the function f, which must be a direct reference of a function defined as ABI0. Otherwise it is a compile-time error. Implemented as a compile intrinsic.
329: type.go:2761 - reflect.funcLayout
   └─ funcLayout computes a struct type representing the layout of the stack-assigned function arguments and return values for the function type t. If rcvr != nil, rcvr specifies the type of the receiver. The returned type exists only for GC, so we only fill out GC relevant info. Currently, that's just size and the GC program. We also fill in the name for possible debugging use.
330: type.go:1947 - reflect.stringFor
331: hashtriemap.go:49 - (*sync.Map).Load

332: abi.go:387 - reflect.newAbiDesc
333: abi.go:165 - (*reflect.abiSeq).addRcvr
   └─ addRcvr extends the abiSeq with a new method call receiver according to the interface calling convention. If the receiver was stack-assigned, returns the single abiStep describing that translation, and nil otherwise. Returns true if the receiver is a pointer.
334: type.go:203 - (*internal/abi.Type).IfaceIndir
   └─ IfaceIndir reports whether t is stored indirectly in an interface value.
335: abi.go:261 - (*reflect.abiSeq).assignIntN
   └─ assignIntN assigns n values to registers, each "size" bytes large, from the data at [offset, offset+n*size) in memory. Each value at [offset+i*size, offset+(i+1)*size) for i < n is assigned to the next n integer registers. Bit i in ptrMap indicates whether the i'th value is a pointer. n must be <= 8. Returns whether assignment succeeded.
336: type.go:200 - (*internal/abi.Type).Pointers
   └─ Pointers reports whether t contains pointers.
337: abi.go:316 - (*reflect.abiSeq).stackAssign
   └─ stackAssign reserves space for one value that is "size" bytes large with alignment "alignment" to the stack. Should not be called directly; use addArg instead.
338: value.go:926 - reflect.align
   └─ align returns the result of rounding x up to a multiple of n. n must be a power of two.
339: type.go:519 - (*internal/abi.FuncType).InSlice
340: type.go:2819 - (*reflect.bitVector).append
   └─ append a bit to the bitmap.
341: abi.go:124 - (*reflect.abiSeq).addArg

342: type.go:442 - (*internal/abi.Type).Size
   └─ Size returns the size of data with type t.
343: type.go:445 - (*internal/abi.Type).Align
   └─ Align returns the alignment of data with type t.
344: abi.go:198 - (*reflect.abiSeq).regAssign [RECURSIVE]
   └─ regAssign attempts to reserve argument registers for a value of type t, stored at some offset. It returns whether or not the assignment succeeded, but leaves any changes it made to a.steps behind, so the caller must undo that work by adjusting a.steps if it fails. This method along with the assign* methods represent the complete register-assignment algorithm for the Go ABI.
345: abi.go:293 - (*reflect.abiSeq).assignFloatN
   └─ assignFloatN assigns n values to registers, each "size" bytes large, from the data at [offset, offset+n*size) in memory. Each value at [offset+i*size, offset+(i+1)*size) for i < n is assigned to the next n floating-point registers. Returns whether assignment succeeded.

352: type.go:679 - abi.NewName
353: type.go:648 - abi.writeVarint
   └─ writeVarint writes n to buf in varint form. Returns the number of bytes written. n must be nonnegative. Writes at most 10 bytes.
354: type.go:545 - reflect.resolveReflectName
   └─ resolveReflectName adds a name to the reflection lookup map in the runtime. It returns a new nameOff that can be used to refer to the pointer.
355: type.go:541 - reflect.addReflectOff
   └─ addReflectOff adds a pointer to the reflection lookup map in the runtime. It returns a new ID that can be used as a typeOff or textOff, and will be resolved correctly. Implemented in the runtime package. addReflectOff should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname.

356: hashtriemap.go:66 - (*sync.Map).LoadOrStore
   └─ LoadOrStore returns the existing value for the key if present. Otherwise, it stores and returns the given value. The loaded result is true if the value was loaded, false if stored.
357: value.go:872 - reflect.methodReceiver
   └─ methodReceiver returns information about the receiver described by v. The Value v may or may not have the flagMethod bit set, so the kind cached in v.flag should not be used. The return value rcvrtype gives the method's actual receiver type. The return value t gives the method type signature (without the receiver). The return value fn is a pointer to the method code.
358: type.go:377 - (*reflect.interfaceType).nameOff

366: value.go:85 - (reflect.flag).kind
367: value.go:1566 - reflect.packIfaceValueIntoEmptyIface
   └─ packIfaceValueIntoEmptyIface converts an interface Value into an empty interface. Precondition: v.kind() == Interface
368: value.go:1893 - (reflect.Value).NumMethod
   └─ NumMethod returns the number of methods in the value's method set. For a non-interface type, it returns the number of exported methods. For an interface type, it returns the number of exported and unexported methods.
369: type.go:613 - (*reflect.rtype).NumMethod
370: type.go:603 - (*reflect.rtype).Kind

377: print.go:587 - (*fmt.pp).catchPanic
378: value.go:3050 - reflect.ValueOf
   └─ ValueOf returns a new Value initialized to the concrete value stored in the interface i. ValueOf(nil) returns the zero Value.
379: value.go:154 - reflect.unpackEface
   └─ unpackEface converts the empty interface i to a Value.
380: value.go:1817 - (reflect.Value).Kind
   └─ Kind returns v's Kind. If v is the zero Value ([Value.IsValid] returns false), Kind returns Invalid.
381: value.go:1605 - (reflect.Value).IsNil
   └─ IsNil reports whether its argument v is nil. The argument must be a chan, func, interface, map, pointer, or slice value; if it is not, IsNil panics. Note that IsNil is not always equivalent to a regular comparison with nil in Go. For example, if v was created by calling [ValueOf] with an uninitialized interface variable i, i==nil will be true but v.IsNil will panic as v will be the zero Value.
382: format.go:577 - (time.Time).GoString
   └─ GoString implements [fmt.GoStringer] and formats t to be printed in Go source code.
383: time.go:765 - (time.Time).absSec
   └─ absSec returns the time t as an absolute seconds, adjusted by the zone offset. It is called when computing a presentation property like Month or Hour. We'd rather call it abs, but there are linknames to abs that make that problematic. See timeAbs below.
384: zoneinfo.go:91 - (*time.Location).get
385: once.go:52 - (*sync.Once).Do
   └─ Do calls the function f if and only if Do is being called for the first time for this instance of [Once]. In other words, given var once Once if once.Do(f) is called multiple times, only the first call will invoke f, even if f has a different value in each invocation. A new instance of Once is required for each function to execute. Do is intended for initialization that must be run exactly once. Since f is niladic, it may be necessary to use a function literal to capture the arguments to a function to be invoked by Do: config.once.Do(func() { config.init(filename) }) Because no call to Do returns until the one call to f returns, if f causes Do to be called, it will deadlock. If f panics, Do considers it to have returned; future calls of Do return without calling f.
386: type.go:19 - (*sync/atomic.Bool).Load
   └─ Load atomically loads and returns the value stored in x.

393: mheap.go:2153 - runtime.addfinalizer
   └─ Adds a finalizer to the object p. Returns true if it succeeded.
394: mfixalloc.go:74 - (*runtime.fixalloc).alloc
395: stubs.go:108 - runtime.memclrNoHeapPointers
   └─ memclrNoHeapPointers clears n bytes starting at ptr. Usually you should use typedmemclr. memclrNoHeapPointers should be used only when the caller knows that *ptr contains no heap pointers because either: *ptr is initialized memory and its type is pointer-free, or *ptr is uninitialized memory (e.g., memory that's being reused for a new allocation) and hence contains only "junk". memclrNoHeapPointers ensures that if ptr is pointer-aligned, and n is a multiple of the pointer size, then any pointer-aligned, pointer-sized portion is cleared atomically. Despite the function name, this is necessary because this function is the underlying implementation of typedmemclr and memclrHasPointers. See the doc of memmove for more details. The (CPU-specific) implementations of this function are in memclr_*.s. memclrNoHeapPointers should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/sonic - github.com/chenzhuoyu/iasm - github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto - github.com/outcaste-io/ristretto Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname memclrNoHeapPointers go:noescape
396: mheap.go:2046 - runtime.addspecial
   └─ addspecial adds the special record s to the list of special records for the object p. All fields of s should be filled in except for offset & next, which this routine will fill in. Returns true if the special was successfully added, false otherwise. (The add will fail only if a record with the same p and s->kind already exists unless force is set to true.)
397: mgcsweep.go:464 - (*runtime.mspan).ensureSwept
   └─ Returns only when span s has been swept. go:nowritebarrier
398: mgcsweep.go:148 - (*runtime.activeSweep).begin
   └─ begin registers a new sweeper. Returns a sweepLocker for acquiring spans for sweeping. Any outstanding sweeper blocks sweep termination. If the sweepLocker is invalid, the caller can be sure that all outstanding sweep work has been drained, so there is nothing left to sweep. Note that there may be sweepers currently running, so this does not indicate that all sweeping has completed. Even if the sweepLocker is invalid, its sweepGen is always valid.
399: mgcsweep.go:341 - (*runtime.sweepLocker).tryAcquire
   └─ tryAcquire attempts to acquire sweep ownership of span s. If it successfully acquires ownership, it blocks sweep completion.
400: mgcsweep.go:504 - (*runtime.sweepLocked).sweep
   └─ sweep frees or collects finalizers for blocks not marked in the mark phase. It clears the mark bits in preparation for the next GC round. Returns true if the span was returned to heap. If preserve=true, don't return it to heap nor relink in mcentral lists; caller takes care of it.
401: traceruntime.go:380 - (runtime.traceLocker).GCSweepSpan
   └─ GCSweepSpan traces the sweep of a single span. If this is the first span swept since traceGCSweepStart was called, this will emit a GCSweepBegin event. This may be called outside a traceGCSweepStart/traceGCSweepDone pair; however, it will not emit any trace events in this case. Must be called with a valid P.
402: traceevent.go:40 - (runtime.traceLocker).eventWriter
   └─ eventWriter creates a new traceEventWriter. It is the main entrypoint for writing trace events. Before creating the event writer, this method will emit a status for the current goroutine or proc if it exists, and if it hasn't had its status emitted yet. goStatus and procStatus indicate what the status of goroutine or P should be immediately *before* the events that are about to be written using the eventWriter (if they exist). No status will be written if there's no active goroutine or P. Callers can elect to pass a constant value here if the status is clear (e.g. a goroutine must have been Runnable before a GoStart). Otherwise, callers can query the status of either the goroutine or P and pass the appropriate status. In this case, the default status should be tracev2.GoBad or tracev2.ProcBad to help identify bugs sooner.
403: tracebuf.go:43 - (runtime.traceLocker).writer
   └─ writer returns an a traceWriter that writes into the current M's stream. Once this is called, the caller must guard against stack growth until end is called on it. Therefore, it's highly recommended to use this API in a "fluent" style, for example tl.writer().event(...).end(). Better yet, callers just looking to write events should use eventWriter when possible, which is a much safer wrapper around this function. nosplit to allow for safe reentrant tracing from stack growth paths. go:nosplit
404: tracestatus.go:90 - (runtime.traceWriter).writeProcStatus
   └─ writeProcStatus emits a ProcStatus event with all the provided information. The caller must have taken ownership of a P's status writing, and the P must be prevented from transitioning. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
405: tracebuf.go:74 - (runtime.traceWriter).event
   └─ event writes out the bytes of an event into the event stream. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
406: tracebuf.go:129 - (runtime.traceWriter).ensure
   └─ ensure makes sure that at least maxSize bytes are available to write. Returns whether the buffer was flushed. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
407: tracebuf.go:335 - (*runtime.traceBuf).available
   └─ nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
408: tracebuf.go:156 - (runtime.traceWriter).refill
   └─ refill puts w.traceBuf on the queue of full buffers and refresh's w's buffer.
409: tracetime.go:58 - runtime.traceClockNow
   └─ traceClockNow returns a monotonic timestamp. The clock this function gets the timestamp from is specific to tracing, and shouldn't be mixed with other clock sources. nosplit because it's called from exitsyscall and various trace writing functions, which are nosplit. traceClockNow is called by runtime/trace and golang.org/x/exp/trace using linkname. go:linkname traceClockNow go:nosplit
410: tracebuf.go:281 - (*runtime.traceBuf).byte
   └─ byte appends v to buf. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
411: tracebuf.go:292 - (*runtime.traceBuf).varint
   └─ varint appends v to buf in little-endian-base-128 encoding. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
412: tracebuf.go:315 - (*runtime.traceBuf).varintReserve
   └─ varintReserve reserves enough space in buf to hold any varint. Space reserved this way can be filled in with the varintAt method. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
413: tracebuf.go:104 - (runtime.traceWriter).end
   └─ end writes the buffer back into the m. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
414: tracestatus.go:172 - (*runtime.traceSchedResourceState).acquireStatus
   └─ acquireStatus acquires the right to emit a Status event for the scheduling resource. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
415: tracestatus.go:181 - (*runtime.traceSchedResourceState).readyNextGen
   └─ readyNextGen readies r for the generation following gen.
416: trace.go:727 - runtime.traceNextGen
417: types.go:213 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uint32).Store
   └─ Store updates the value atomically. go:nosplit
418: tracestatus.go:188 - (*runtime.traceSchedResourceState).statusWasTraced
   └─ statusWasTraced returns true if the sched resource's status was already acquired for tracing.
419: tracestatus.go:20 - (runtime.traceWriter).writeGoStatus
   └─ writeGoStatus emits a GoStatus event as well as any active ranges on the goroutine. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
420: traceevent.go:58 - (runtime.traceLocker).stack
   └─ stack takes a stack trace skipping the provided number of frames. It then returns a traceArg representing that stack which may be passed to write.
421: tracestack.go:32 - runtime.traceStack
   └─ traceStack captures a stack trace from a goroutine and registers it in the trace stack table. It then returns its unique ID. If gp == nil, then traceStack will attempt to use the current execution context. skip controls the number of leaf frames to omit in order to hide tracer internals from stack traces, see CL 5523. Avoid calling this function directly. Prefer traceEventWriter.stack.
422: tracestatus.go:115 - runtime.goStatusToTraceGoStatus
   └─ goStatusToTraceGoStatus translates the internal status to tracGoStatus. status must not be _Gdead or any status whose name has the suffix "_unused." nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
423: runtime2.go:1168 - (runtime.waitReason).isWaitingForSuspendG
424: tracestack.go:264 - runtime.fpTracebackPCs
   └─ fpTracebackPCs populates pcBuf with the return addresses for each frame and returns the number of PCs written to pcBuf. The returned PCs correspond to "physical frames" rather than "logical frames"; that is if A is inlined into B, this will return a PC for only B.
425: tracestack.go:147 - (*runtime.traceStackTable).put
   └─ put returns a unique id for the stack trace pcs and caches it in the table, if it sees the trace for the first time.
426: tracemap.go:67 - (*runtime.traceMap).put
   └─ put inserts the data into the table. It's always safe for callers to noescape data because put copies its bytes. Returns a unique ID for the data and whether this is the first time the data has been added to the map.
427: alg.go:68 - runtime.memhash
   └─ memhash should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname.

428: tracemap.go:115 - (*runtime.traceMap).newTraceMapNode
429: traceregion.go:43 - (*runtime.traceRegionAlloc).alloc
   └─ alloc allocates n-byte block. The block is always aligned to 8 bytes, regardless of platform.
430: stubs.go:145 - runtime.memmove
   └─ memmove copies n bytes from "from" to "to". memmove ensures that any pointer in "from" is written to "to" with an indivisible write, so that racy reads cannot observe a half-written pointer. This is necessary to prevent the garbage collector from observing invalid pointers, and differs from memmove in unmanaged languages. However, memmove is only required to do this if "from" and "to" may contain pointers, which can only be the case if "from", "to", and "n" are all be word-aligned. Implementations are in memmove_*.s. Outside assembly calls memmove. memmove should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname.

See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname memmove go:noescape
431: types.go:504 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.UnsafePointer).CompareAndSwapNoWB
   └─ CompareAndSwapNoWB atomically (with respect to other methods) compares u's value with old, and if they're equal, swaps u's value with new. It reports whether the swap ran. WARNING: As the name implies this operation does *not* perform a write barrier on value, and so this operation may hide pointers from the GC. Use with care and sparingly. It is safe to use with values not found in the Go heap. Prefer CompareAndSwap instead. go:nosplit
432: stubs.go:15 - atomic.Casp1
   └─ NO go:noescape annotation; see atomic_pointer.go.
433: stubs.go:167 - runtime.memequal
   └─ in internal/bytealg/equal_*.s memequal should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname.

436: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:11 - (*runtime.mspan).markBitsForIndex
437: mbitmap.go:1216 - (runtime.markBits).isMarked

438: mheap.go:2784 - (*runtime.specialsIter).valid
439: mbitmap.go:1229 - (runtime.markBits).setMarkedNonAtomic
   └─ setMarkedNonAtomic sets the marked bit in the markbits, non-atomically.
440: mheap.go:2795 - (*runtime.specialsIter).unlinkAndNext
   └─ unlinkAndNext removes the current special from the list and moves the iterator to the next special. It returns the unlinked special.
441: mheap.go:2804 - runtime.freeSpecial
   └─ freeSpecial performs any cleanup on special s and deallocates it. s must already be unlinked from the specials list.
442: mfinal.go:101 - runtime.queuefinalizer
443: types.go:279 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uint32).Or
   └─ Or takes value and performs a bit-wise "or" operation with the value of u, storing the result into u. The full process is performed atomically. go:nosplit

   └─ mp returns the memRecord associated with the memProfile bucket b.
451: mcleanup.go:378 - (*runtime.cleanupQueue).enqueue
   └─ enqueue queues a single cleanup for execution. Called by the sweeper, and only the sweeper.
452: mcleanup.go:248 - (*runtime.cleanupBlock).enqueue
   └─ enqueue pushes a single cleanup function into the block. Returns if this enqueue call filled the block. This is odd, but we want to flush full blocks eagerly to get cleanups running as soon as possible. Must only be called if the GC is in the sweep phase (gcphase == _GCoff), because it does not synchronize with the garbage collector.
453: mcleanup.go:255 - (*runtime.cleanupBlock).full
   └─ full returns true if the cleanup block is full.

   └─ HeapObjectFree records that an object at addr is about to be freed.
474: traceallocfree.go:132 - runtime.traceHeapObjectID
   └─ traceHeapObjectID creates a trace ID for a heap object at address addr.

   └─ OnesCount64 returns the number of one bits ("population count") in x.
484: mgcsweep.go:858 - (*runtime.mspan).reportZombies
   └─ reportZombies reports any marked but free objects in s and throws. This generally means one of the following: 1. User code converted a pointer to a uintptr and then back unsafely, and a GC ran while the uintptr was the only reference to an object. 2. User code (or a compiler bug) constructed a bad pointer that points to a free slot, often a past-the-end pointer. 3. The GC two cycles ago missed a pointer and freed a live object, but it was still live in the last cycle, so this GC cycle found a pointer to that object and marked it.
485: mheap.go:2921 - runtime.newMarkBits
   └─ newMarkBits returns a pointer to 8 byte aligned bytes to be used for a span's mark bits.
486: mheap.go:2905 - (*runtime.gcBitsArena).tryAlloc
   └─ tryAlloc allocates from b or returns nil if b does not have enough room. This is safe to call concurrently.
487: mheap.go:3017 - runtime.newArenaMayUnlock
   └─ newArenaMayUnlock allocates and zeroes a gcBits arena. The caller must hold gcBitsArena.lock. This may temporarily release it.
488: pinner.go:295 - (*runtime.mspan).refreshPinnerBits
   └─ refreshPinnerBits replaces pinnerBits with a fresh copy in the arenas for the next GC cycle. If it does not contain any pinned objects, pinnerBits of the span is set to nil.

   └─ atomicstorep performs *ptr = new atomically and invokes a write barrier. go:nosplit
494: atomic_pointer.go:32 - runtime.atomicwb
   └─ atomicwb performs a write barrier before an atomic pointer write. The caller should guard the call with "if writeBarrier.enabled". atomicwb should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/gopkg - github.com/songzhibin97/gkit Do not remove or change the type signature.

   └─ go:nowritebarrierrec go:nosplit
496: mwbbuf.go:166 - runtime.wbBufFlush
   └─ wbBufFlush flushes the current P's write barrier buffer to the GC workbufs. This must not have write barriers because it is part of the write barrier implementation. This and everything it calls must be nosplit because 1) the stack contains untyped slots from gcWriteBarrier and 2) there must not be a GC safe point between the write barrier test in the caller and flushing the buffer. TODO: A "go:nosplitrec" annotation would be perfect for this. go:nowritebarrierrec go:nosplit
497: mwbbuf.go:100 - (*runtime.wbBuf).discard
   └─ discard resets b's next pointer, but not its end pointer. This must be nosplit because it's called by wbBufFlush. go:nosplit
498: cgocheck.go:25 - runtime.cgoCheckPtrWrite
   └─ cgoCheckPtrWrite is called whenever a pointer is stored into memory. It throws if the program is storing an unpinned Go pointer into non-Go memory. This is called from generated code when GOEXPERIMENT=cgocheck2 is enabled. go:nosplit go:nowritebarrier
499: cgocall.go:759 - runtime.cgoIsGoPointer

501: symtab.go:509 - runtime.activeModules
   └─ activeModules returns a slice of active modules. A module is active once its gcdatamask and gcbssmask have been assembled and it is usable by the GC. This is nosplit/nowritebarrier because it is called by the cgo pointer checking code. go:nosplit go:nowritebarrier
502: cgocall.go:781 - runtime.cgoInRange
   └─ cgoInRange reports whether p is between start and end. go:nosplit go:nowritebarrierrec

507: mbitmap.go:1075 - (*runtime.mspan).refillAllocCache
   └─ refillAllocCache takes 8 bytes s.allocBits starting at whichByte and negates them so that ctz (count trailing zeros) instructions can be used. It then places these 8 bytes into the cached 64 bit s.allocCache.
508: mheap.go:598 - (runtime.spanClass).sizeclass

   └─ go:nosplit
520: mstats.go:776 - (*runtime.consistentHeapStats).acquire
   └─ acquire returns a heapStatsDelta to be updated. In effect, it acquires the shard for writing. release must be called as soon as the relevant deltas are updated. The returned heapStatsDelta must be updated atomically. The caller's P must not change between acquire and release. This also means that the caller should not acquire a P or release its P in between. A P also must not acquire a given consistentHeapStats if it hasn't yet released it. nosplit because a stack growth in this function could lead to a stack allocation that could reenter the function. go:nosplit
521: mstats.go:805 - (*runtime.consistentHeapStats).release
   └─ release indicates that the writer is done modifying the delta. The value returned by the corresponding acquire must no longer be accessed or modified after release is called. The caller's P must not change between acquire and release. This also means that the caller should not acquire a P or release its P in between. nosplit because a stack growth in this function could lead to a stack allocation that causes another acquire before this operation has completed. go:nosplit
522: mheap.go:1632 - (*runtime.mheap).freeSpan
   └─ Free the span back into the heap.
523: mcentral.go:65 - (*runtime.mcentral).partialSwept
   └─ partialSwept returns the spanSet which holds partially-filled swept spans for this sweepgen.
524: mem.go:143 - runtime.sysFault
   └─ sysFault transitions a memory region from Ready to Reserved. It marks a region such that it will always fault if accessed. Used only for debugging the runtime. TODO(mknyszek): Currently it's true that all uses of sysFault transition memory from Ready to Reserved, but this may not be true in the future since on every platform the operation is much more general than that. If a transition from Prepared is ever introduced, create a new function that elides the Ready state accounting.

529: types.go:308 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uint64).Load
   └─ Load accesses and returns the value atomically. go:nosplit
530: mcleanup.go:449 - (*runtime.cleanupQueue).flush
   └─ flush pushes all active cleanup blocks to the full list and wakes up cleanup goroutines to handle them. Must only be called at a point when we can guarantee that no more cleanups are being queued, such as after the final sweeper for the cycle is done but before the next mark phase.
531: mcleanup.go:265 - (*runtime.cleanupBlock).take
   └─ take moves as many cleanups as possible from b into a.
532: mcleanup.go:260 - (*runtime.cleanupBlock).empty
   └─ empty returns true if the cleanup block is empty.
533: mheap.go:2118 - (*runtime.mspan).specialFindSplicePoint
   └─ Find a splice point in the sorted list and check for an already existing record. Returns a pointer to the next-reference in the list predecessor. Returns true, if the referenced item is an exact match.
534: mheap.go:2025 - runtime.spanHasSpecials
   └─ spanHasSpecials marks a span as having specials in the arena bitmap.
535: mbitmap.go:1319 - runtime.findObject
   └─ findObject returns the base address for the heap object containing the address p, the object's span, and the index of the object in s. If p does not point into a heap object, it returns base == 0. If p points is an invalid heap pointer and debug.invalidptr != 0, findObject panics. refBase and refOff optionally give the base address of the object in which the pointer p was found and the byte offset at which it was found. These are used for error reporting. It is nosplit so it is safe for p to be a pointer to the current goroutine's stack. Since p is a uintptr, it would not be adjusted if the stack were to move. findObject should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/sonic Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname findObject go:nosplit
536: mbitmap.go:1266 - runtime.badPointer
   └─ badPointer throws bad pointer in heap panic.
537: mgcmark.go:1717 - runtime.gcDumpObject
   └─ gcDumpObject dumps the contents of obj for debugging and marks the field at byte offset off in obj.
538: mheap.go:603 - (runtime.spanClass).noscan
   └─ go:nosplit
539: mgcmark.go:1444 - runtime.scanobject
   └─ scanobject scans the object starting at b, adding pointers to gcw. b must point to the beginning of a heap object or an oblet. scanobject consults the GC bitmap for the pointer mask and the spans for the size of the object. go:nowritebarrier
540: intrinsics.go:200 - sys.Prefetch
   └─ Prefetch prefetches data from memory addr to cache AMD64: Produce PREFETCHT0 instruction ARM64: Produce PRFM instruction with PLDL1KEEP option
541: mheap.go:735 - runtime.spanOfUnchecked
   └─ spanOfUnchecked is equivalent to spanOf, but the caller must ensure that p points into an allocated heap arena. Must be nosplit because it has callers that are nosplit. go:nosplit
542: mbitmap.go:135 - (*runtime.mspan).typePointersOfUnchecked
   └─ typePointersOfUnchecked is like typePointersOf, but assumes addr is the base of an allocation slot in a span (the start of the object if no header, the header otherwise). It returns an iterator that generates all pointers in the range [addr, addr+span.elemsize). nosplit because it is used during write barriers and must not be preempted. go:nosplit
543: mbitmap.go:342 - (*runtime.mspan).objBase
   └─ objBase returns the base pointer for the object containing addr in span. Assumes that addr points into a valid part of span (span.base() <= addr < span.limit). go:nosplit
544: mbitmap.go:76 - runtime.heapBitsInSpan
   └─ heapBitsInSpan returns true if the size of an object implies its ptr/scalar data is stored at the end of the span, and is accessible via span.heapBits. Note: this works for both rounded-up sizes (span.elemsize) and unrounded type sizes because gc.MinSizeForMallocHeader is guaranteed to be at a size class boundary. go:nosplit
545: mbitmap.go:585 - (*runtime.mspan).heapBitsSmallForAddr
   └─ heapBitsSmallForAddr loads the heap bits for the object stored at addr from span.heapBits. addr must be the base pointer of an object in the span. heapBitsInSpan(span.elemsize) must be true. go:nosplit
546: mbitmap.go:570 - runtime.spanHeapBitsRange
   └─ go:nosplit
547: type.go:88 - runtime.getGCMask
   └─ getGCMask returns the pointer/nonpointer bitmask for type t. nosplit because it is used during write barriers and must not be preempted. go:nosplit
548: type.go:103 - runtime.getGCMaskOnDemand

552: mbitmap.go:283 - (runtime.typePointers).fastForward
   └─ fastForward moves the iterator forward by n bytes. n must be a multiple of goarch.PtrSize. limit must be the same limit passed to next for this iterator. nosplit because it is used during write barriers and must not be preempted. go:nosplit
553: stubs.go:372 - runtime.alignDown
   └─ alignDown rounds n down to a multiple of a. a must be a power of 2. go:nosplit
554: mgcwork.go:199 - (*runtime.gcWork).putObjFast
   └─ putObjFast does a put and reports whether it can be done quickly otherwise it returns false and the caller needs to call put. go:nowritebarrierrec
555: mgcwork.go:156 - (*runtime.gcWork).putObj
   └─ putObj enqueues a pointer for the garbage collector to trace. obj must point to the beginning of a heap object or an oblet. go:nowritebarrierrec
556: mgcwork.go:143 - (*runtime.gcWork).init
557: mgcwork.go:410 - runtime.getempty

561: lfstack.go:56 - runtime.lfnodeValidate
   └─ lfnodeValidate panics if node is not a valid address for use with lfstack.push. This only needs to be called when node is allocated.
562: mgcwork.go:466 - runtime.putempty
   └─ putempty puts a workbuf onto the work.empty list. Upon entry this goroutine owns b. The lfstack.push relinquishes ownership. go:nowritebarrier
563: mgcwork.go:485 - runtime.trygetfull
   └─ trygetfull tries to get a full or partially empty workbuffer. If one is not immediately available return nil. go:nowritebarrier
564: mgcwork.go:394 - (*runtime.workbuf).checknonempty
565: mgcwork.go:476 - runtime.putfull
   └─ putfull puts the workbuf on the work.full list for the GC. putfull accepts partially full buffers so the GC can avoid competing with the mutators for ownership of partially full buffers. go:nowritebarrier
566: mgcpacer.go:697 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).enlistWorker
   └─ enlistWorker encourages another dedicated mark worker to start on another P if there are spare worker slots. It is used by putfull when more work is made available. If goexperiment.GreenTeaGC, the caller must not hold a G's scan bit, otherwise this could cause a deadlock. This is already enforced by the static lock ranking. go:nowritebarrier

   └─ Load accesses and returns the value atomically. go:nosplit
568: stubs.go:47 - atomic.Loadint64
   └─ go:noescape
569: mgcpacer.go:1408 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).needIdleMarkWorker
   └─ needIdleMarkWorker is a hint as to whether another idle mark worker is needed. The caller must still call addIdleMarkWorker to become one. This is mainly useful for a quick check before an expensive operation. nosplit because it may be called without a P. go:nosplit
570: types.go:20 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Int32).Load

573: proc.go:6996 - runtime.pidlegetSpinning
   └─ pidlegetSpinning tries to get a p from the _Pidle list, acquiring ownership. This is called by spinning Ms (or callers than need a spinning M) that have found work. If no P is available, this must synchronized with non-spinning Ms that may be preparing to drop their P without discovering this work. sched.lock must be held. May run during STW, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrierrec
574: proc.go:6968 - runtime.pidleget
   └─ pidleget tries to get a p from the _Pidle list, acquiring ownership. sched.lock must be held. May run during STW, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrierrec

583: mgclimit.go:377 - (runtime.limiterEventStamp).duration
   └─ duration computes the difference between now and the start time stored in the stamp. Returns 0 if the difference is negative, which may happen if now is stale or if the before and after timestamps cross a 2^(64-limiterEventBits) boundary.
584: mgclimit.go:156 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).addIdleTime
   └─ addIdleTime notifies the limiter of additional time a P spent on the idle list. It will be subtracted from the total CPU time in the next update.

   └─ go:noescape
588: proc.go:3026 - runtime.startm
   └─ Schedules some M to run the p (creates an M if necessary). If p==nil, tries to get an idle P, if no idle P's does nothing. May run with m.p==nil, so write barriers are not allowed. If spinning is set, the caller has incremented nmspinning and must provide a P. startm will set m.spinning in the newly started M. Callers passing a non-nil P must call from a non-preemptible context. See comment on acquirem below. Argument lockheld indicates whether the caller already acquired the scheduler lock. Callers holding the lock when making the call must pass true. The lock might be temporarily dropped, but will be reacquired before returning. Must not have write barriers because this may be called without a P. go:nowritebarrierrec
589: proc.go:6825 - runtime.mget

592: proc.go:5554 - runtime.mcount
593: proc.go:2848 - runtime.newm
   └─ Create a new m. It will start off with a call to fn, or else the scheduler. fn needs to be static and not a heap allocated closure. May run with m.p==nil, so write barriers are not allowed. id is optional pre-allocated m ID. Omit by passing -1. go:nowritebarrierrec
594: proc.go:2270 - runtime.allocm
   └─ Allocate a new m unassociated with any thread. Can use p for allocation context if needed. fn is recorded as the new m's m.mstartfn. id is optional pre-allocated m ID. Omit by passing -1. This function is allowed to have write barriers even if the caller isn't because it borrows pp. go:yeswritebarrierrec

597: proc.go:6001 - runtime.acquirep
   └─ Associate p and the current m. This function is allowed to have write barriers even if the caller isn't because it immediately acquires pp. go:yeswritebarrierrec
598: mcache.go:322 - (*runtime.mcache).prepareForSweep

   └─ HeapAlloc emits a HeapAlloc event.
602: mgcpacer.go:492 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).revise
   └─ revise updates the assist ratio during the GC cycle to account for improved estimates. This should be called whenever gcController.heapScan, gcController.heapLive, or if any inputs to gcController.heapGoal are updated. It is safe to call concurrently, but it may race with other calls to revise. The result of this race is that the two assist ratio values may not line up or may be stale. In practice this is OK because the assist ratio moves slowly throughout a GC cycle, and the assist ratio is a best-effort heuristic anyway. Furthermore, no part of the heuristic depends on the two assist ratio values being exact reciprocals of one another, since the two values are used to convert values from different sources. The worst case result of this raciness is that we may miss a larger shift in the ratio (say, if we decide to pace more aggressively against the hard heap goal) but even this "hard goal" is best-effort (see #40460). The dedicated GC should ensure we don't exceed the hard goal by too much in the rare case we do exceed it. It should only be called when gcBlackenEnabled != 0 (because this is when assists are enabled and the necessary statistics are available).
603: mgcpacer.go:934 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).heapGoal

615: mheap.go:1676 - (*runtime.mheap).freeManual
   └─ freeManual frees a manually-managed span returned by allocManual. typ must be the same as the spanAllocType passed to the allocManual that allocated s. This must only be called when gcphase == _GCoff. See mSpanState for an explanation. freeManual must be called on the system stack because it acquires the heap lock. See mheap for details. go:systemstack

658: proc.go:983 - runtime.mcommoninit
   └─ Pre-allocated ID may be passed as 'id', or omitted by passing -1.
659: rand.go:188 - runtime.mrandinit
   └─ mrandinit initializes the random state of an m.
660: rand.go:121 - runtime.bootstrapRand
   └─ bootstrapRand returns a random uint64 from the global random generator.
661: chacha8.go:53 - (*internal/chacha8rand.State).Next
   └─ Next returns the next random value, along with a boolean indicating whether one was available. If one is not available, the caller should call Refill and then repeat the call to Next. Next is //go:nosplit to allow its use in the runtime with per-m data without holding the per-m lock. go:nosplit
662: chacha8.go:84 - (*internal/chacha8rand.State).Refill
   └─ Refill refills the state with more random values. After a call to Refill, an immediate call to Next will succeed (unless multiple goroutines are incorrectly sharing a state).
663: chacha8.go:29 - chacha8rand.block
   └─ block is the chacha8rand block function.
664: rand.go:137 - runtime.bootstrapRandReseed
   └─ bootstrapRandReseed reseeds the bootstrap random number generator, clearing from memory any trace of previously returned random numbers.
665: chacha8.go:112 - (*internal/chacha8rand.State).Reseed
   └─ Reseed reseeds the state with new random values. After a call to Reseed, any previously returned random values have been erased from the memory of the state and cannot be recovered.
666: chacha8.go:73 - (*internal/chacha8rand.State).Init64
   └─ Init64 seeds the state with the given seed value.
667: rand.go:160 - runtime.rand
   └─ rand returns a random uint64 from the per-m chacha8 state. This is called from compiler-generated code. Do not change signature: used via linkname from other packages. go:nosplit go:linkname rand
668: os_linux.go:390 - runtime.mpreinit
   └─ Called to initialize a new m (including the bootstrap m). Called on the parent thread (main thread in case of bootstrap), can allocate memory.
669: proc.go:5122 - runtime.malg
   └─ Allocate a new g, with a stack big enough for stacksize bytes.
670: stack.go:995 - runtime.round2
   └─ round x up to a power of 2.
671: proc.go:1026 - runtime.mProfStackInit
   └─ mProfStackInit is used to eagerly initialize stack trace buffers for profiling. Lazy allocation would have to deal with reentrancy issues in malloc and runtime locks for mLockProfile. TODO(mknyszek): Implement lazy allocation if this becomes a problem.
672: proc.go:1039 - runtime.makeProfStackFP
   └─ makeProfStackFP creates a buffer large enough to hold a maximum-sized stack trace as well as any additional frames needed for frame pointer unwinding with delayed inline expansion.
673: traceruntime.go:684 - runtime.traceThreadDestroy
   └─ traceThreadDestroy is called when a thread is removed from sched.freem. mp must not be able to emit trace events anymore. sched.lock must be held to synchronize with traceAdvance.
674: traceruntime.go:163 - runtime.traceShuttingDown
   └─ traceShuttingDown returns true if the trace is currently shutting down.
675: proc.go:1832 - runtime.mStackIsSystemAllocated
   └─ mStackIsSystemAllocated indicates whether this runtime starts on a system-allocated stack.
676: proc.go:6052 - runtime.releasep
   └─ Disassociate p and the current m.
677: traceruntime.go:302 - (runtime.traceLocker).ProcStop
   └─ ProcStop traces a ProcStop event.
678: proc.go:6062 - runtime.releasepNoTrace
   └─ Disassociate p and the current m without tracing an event.
679: rwmutex.go:101 - (*runtime.rwmutex).runlock
   └─ runlock undoes a single rlock call on rw.
680: lockrank_off.go:41 - runtime.releaseLockRankAndM
   └─ This function may be called in nosplit context and thus must be nosplit. go:nosplit
681: lock_futex.go:26 - runtime.notewakeup
682: lock_futex.go:17 - runtime.key32
   └─ We use the uintptr mutex.key and note.key as a uint32. go:nosplit
683: atomic_amd64.go:64 - atomic.Xchg
   └─ go:noescape
684: proc.go:2897 - runtime.newm1
685: os_linux.go:173 - runtime.newosproc
   └─ May run with m.p==nil, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrier
686: os_linux.go:453 - runtime.sigprocmask
   └─ go:nosplit go:nowritebarrierrec
687: os_linux.go:449 - runtime.rtsigprocmask
   └─ go:noescape
688: retry.go:14 - runtime.retryOnEAGAIN
   └─ retryOnEAGAIN retries a function until it does not return EAGAIN. It will use an increasing delay between calls, and retry up to 20 times. The function argument is expected to return an errno value, and retryOnEAGAIN will return any errno value other than EAGAIN. If all retries return EAGAIN, then retryOnEAGAIN will return EAGAIN.
689: os_linux.go:186 - runtime.newosproc$1
690: os_linux.go:168 - runtime.clone
   └─ go:noescape
691: stubs2.go:24 - runtime.usleep_no_g
   └─ go:nosplit
692: stubs2.go:21 - runtime.usleep
693: proc.go:7013 - runtime.runqempty
   └─ runqempty reports whether pp has no Gs on its local run queue. It never returns true spuriously.
694: proc.go:6481 - runtime.preemptone
   └─ Tell the goroutine running on processor P to stop. This function is purely best-effort. It can incorrectly fail to inform the goroutine. It can inform the wrong goroutine. Even if it informs the correct goroutine, that goroutine might ignore the request if it is simultaneously executing newstack. No lock needs to be held. Returns true if preemption request was issued. The actual preemption will happen at some point in the future and will be indicated by the gp->status no longer being Grunning
695: signal_unix.go:368 - runtime.preemptM
   └─ preemptM sends a preemption request to mp. This request may be handled asynchronously and may be coalesced with other requests to the M. When the request is received, if the running G or P are marked for preemption and the goroutine is at an asynchronous safe-point, it will preempt the goroutine. It always atomically increments mp.preemptGen after handling a preemption request.
696: os_linux.go:570 - runtime.signalM
   └─ signalM sends a signal to mp.
697: os_linux.go:566 - runtime.getpid
698: os_linux.go:567 - runtime.tgkill
699: mbitmap.go:212 - (runtime.typePointers).nextFast
   └─ nextFast is the fast path of next. nextFast is written to be inlineable and, as the name implies, fast. Callers that are performance-critical should iterate using the following pattern: for { var addr uintptr if tp, addr = tp.nextFast(); addr == 0 { if tp, addr = tp.next(limit); addr == 0 { break } } // Use addr. ... } nosplit because it is used during write barriers and must not be preempted. go:nosplit
700: intrinsics.go:44 - sys.TrailingZeros32
   └─ TrailingZeros32 returns the number of trailing zero bits in x; the result is 32 for x == 0.
701: mbitmap.go:243 - (runtime.typePointers).next
   └─ next advances the pointers iterator, returning the updated iterator and the address of the next pointer. limit must be the same each time it is passed to next. nosplit because it is used during write barriers and must not be preempted. go:nosplit
702: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:20 - runtime.tryDeferToSpanScan
703: mgcmark.go:1660 - runtime.greyobject
   └─ obj is the start of an object with mark mbits. If it isn't already marked, mark it and enqueue into gcw. base and off are for debugging only and could be removed. See also wbBufFlush1, which partially duplicates this logic. go:nowritebarrierrec
704: mcheckmark.go:80 - runtime.setCheckmark
   └─ setCheckmark throws if marking object is a checkmarks violation, and otherwise sets obj's checkmark. It returns true if obj was already checkmarked.
705: mcheckmark.go:107 - runtime.getCheckmark
706: mbitmap.go:1152 - (*runtime.mspan).isFree
   └─ isFree reports whether the index'th object in s is unallocated. The caller must ensure s.state is mSpanInUse, and there must have been no preemption points since ensuring this (which could allow a GC transition, which would allow the state to change). Callers must ensure that the index passed here must not have been produced from a pointer that came from 'thin air', as might happen with conservative scanning.
707: mbitmap.go:1221 - (runtime.markBits).setMarked
   └─ setMarked sets the marked bit in the markbits, atomically.
708: mgcmark.go:1402 - runtime.scanblock
   └─ scanblock scans b as scanobject would, but using an explicit pointer bitmap instead of the heap bitmap. This is used to scan non-heap roots, so it does not update gcw.bytesMarked or gcw.heapScanWork. If stk != nil, possible stack pointers are also reported to stk.putPtr. go:nowritebarrier
709: mgcstack.go:202 - (*runtime.stackScanState).putPtr
   └─ Add p as a potential pointer to a stack object. p must be a stack address.
710: mheap.go:2258 - runtime.setFinalizerContext
   └─ setFinalizerContext adds a specialCheckFinalizer to ptr. ptr must already have a finalizer special attached.
711: mheap.go:2265 - runtime.setCleanupContext
   └─ setCleanupContext adds a specialCheckFinalizer to ptr. ptr must already have a finalizer or cleanup special attached. Pass 0 for the cleanupID to indicate a finalizer.
712: makefunc.go:78 - reflect.makeFuncStub
   └─ makeFuncStub is an assembly function that is the code half of the function returned from MakeFunc. It expects a *callReflectFunc as its context register, and its job is to invoke callReflect(ctxt, frame) where ctxt is the context register and frame is a pointer to the first word in the passed-in argument frame.
713: decoder.go:318 - zstd.DecodeAll$1
714: zstd.go:107 - zstd.printf
715: log.go:407 - log.Printf
   └─ Printf calls Output to print to the standard logger. Arguments are handled in the manner of [fmt.Printf].
716: log.go:201 - (*log.Logger).output
   └─ output can take either a calldepth or a pc to get source line information. It uses the pc if it is non-zero.
717: time.go:1343 - time.Now
   └─ Now returns the current local time.
718: time.go:1320 - time.runtimeNow
   └─ runtimeNow returns the current time. When called within a synctest.Run bubble, it returns the group's fake clock. go:linkname runtimeNow
719: log.go:344 - (*log.Logger).Prefix
   └─ Prefix returns the output prefix for the logger.
720: log.go:333 - (*log.Logger).Flags
   └─ Flags returns the output flags for the logger. The flag bits are [Ldate], [Ltime], and so on.
721: type.go:80 - (*sync/atomic.Int32).Load
   └─ Load atomically loads and returns the value stored in x.
722: doc.go:177 - atomic.LoadInt32
   └─ LoadInt32 atomically loads *addr. Consider using the more ergonomic and less error-prone [Int32.Load] instead. go:noescape
723: log.go:168 - log.getBuffer
724: log.go:174 - log.putBuffer
725: pool.go:99 - (*sync.Pool).Put
   └─ Put adds x to the pool.
726: pool.go:83 - sync.runtime_randn
   └─ from runtime go:linkname runtime_randn runtime.randn
727: norace.go:22 - race.ReleaseMerge
728: poolqueue.go:220 - (*sync.poolChain).pushHead
729: poolqueue.go:80 - (*sync.poolDequeue).pushHead
   └─ pushHead adds val at the head of the queue. It returns false if the queue is full. It must only be called by a single producer.
730: doc.go:193 - atomic.LoadPointer
   └─ LoadPointer atomically loads *addr. Consider using the more ergonomic and less error-prone [Pointer.Load] instead.
731: type.go:195 - (*sync/atomic.Uint64).Add
   └─ Add atomically adds delta to x and returns the new value.
732: doc_64.go:51 - atomic.AddUint64
   └─ AddUint64 atomically adds delta to *addr and returns the new value. To subtract a signed positive constant value c from x, do AddUint64(&x, ^uint64(c-1)). In particular, to decrement x, do AddUint64(&x, ^uint64(0)). Consider using the more ergonomic and less error-prone [Uint64.Add] instead (particularly if you target 32-bit platforms; see the bugs section). go:noescape
733: log.go:114 - log.formatHeader
   └─ formatHeader writes log header to buf in following order: - l.prefix (if it's not blank and Lmsgprefix is unset), - date and/or time (if corresponding flags are provided), - file and line number (if corresponding flags are provided), - l.prefix (if it's not blank and Lmsgprefix is set).
734: time.go:1364 - (time.Time).UTC
   └─ UTC returns t with the location set to UTC.
735: time.go:217 - (*time.Time).setLoc
   └─ setLoc sets the location associated with the time.
736: time.go:226 - (*time.Time).stripMono

737: time.go:181 - (*time.Time).sec
   └─ sec returns the time's seconds since Jan 1 year 1.
738: time.go:808 - (time.Time).Date
   └─ Date returns the year, month, and day in which t occurs.
739: time.go:634 - (time.absSeconds).days
   └─ days converts absolute seconds to absolute days.
740: time.go:743 - (time.absDays).date
   └─ date converts days into standard year, month, day.
741: time.go:639 - (time.absDays).split
   └─ split splits days into century, cyear, ayday.
742: bits.go:459 - bits.Mul32
   └─ Mul32 returns the 64-bit product of x and y: (hi, lo) = x * y with the product bits' upper half returned in hi and the lower half returned in lo. This function's execution time does not depend on the inputs.
743: time.go:677 - (time.absYday).split
   └─ split splits ayday into absolute month and standard (1-based) day-in-month.
744: time.go:697 - (time.absYday).janFeb
   └─ janFeb returns 1 if the March 1-based ayday is in January or February, 0 otherwise.
745: time.go:731 - (time.absCentury).year
   └─ year returns the standard year for (century, cyear, janFeb).
746: time.go:707 - (time.absMonth).month
   └─ month returns the standard Month for (m, janFeb)
747: log.go:93 - log.itoa
   └─ Cheap integer to fixed-width decimal ASCII. Give a negative width to avoid zero-padding.
748: time.go:866 - (time.Time).Clock
   └─ Clock returns the hour, minute, and second within the day specified by t.
749: time.go:871 - (time.absSeconds).clock
   └─ clock returns the hour, minute, and second within the day specified by abs.
750: time.go:897 - (time.Time).Nanosecond
   └─ Nanosecond returns the nanosecond offset within the second specified by t, in the range [0, 999999999].
751: time.go:176 - (*time.Time).nsec
   └─ nsec returns the time's nanoseconds.
752: log.go:416 - log.Println$1
753: print.go:330 - fmt.Appendln
   └─ Appendln formats using the default formats for its operands, appends the result to the byte slice, and returns the updated slice. Spaces are always added between operands and a newline is appended.
754: print.go:1215 - (*fmt.pp).doPrintln
   └─ doPrintln is like doPrint but always adds a space between arguments and a newline after the last argument.
755: print.go:161 - (*fmt.pp).free
   └─ free saves used pp structs in ppFree; avoids an allocation per invocation.
756: log.go:408 - log.Printf$1
757: print.go:247 - fmt.Appendf
   └─ Appendf formats according to a format specifier, appends the result to the byte slice, and returns the updated slice.
758: extern.go:315 - runtime.Caller
   └─ Caller reports file and line number information about function invocations on the calling goroutine's stack. The argument skip is the number of stack frames to ascend, with 0 identifying the caller of Caller. (For historical reasons the meaning of skip differs between Caller and [Callers].) The return values report the program counter, the file name (using forward slashes as path separator, even on Windows), and the line number within the file of the corresponding call. The boolean ok is false if it was not possible to recover the information.
759: symtab.go:80 - runtime.CallersFrames
   └─ CallersFrames takes a slice of PC values returned by [Callers] and prepares to return function/file/line information. Do not change the slice until you are done with the [Frames].
760: symtab.go:95 - (*runtime.Frames).Next
   └─ Next returns a [Frame] representing the next call frame in the slice of PC values. If it has already returned all call frames, Next returns a zero [Frame]. The more result indicates whether the next call to Next will return a valid [Frame]. It does not necessarily indicate whether this call returned one. See the [Frames] example for idiomatic usage.
761: symtab.go:875 - (runtime.funcInfo)._Func
762: symtab.go:815 - (*runtime.Func).Entry
   └─ Entry returns the entry address of the function.
763: symtab.go:346 - (*runtime.Func).raw
764: symtab.go:880 - (*runtime._func).isInlined
   └─ isInlined reports whether f should be re-interpreted as a *funcinl.
765: symtab.go:354 - (*runtime._func).funcInfo
766: symtab.go:298 - runtime.expandCgoFrames
   └─ expandCgoFrames expands frame information for pc, known to be a non-Go function, using the cgoSymbolizer hook. expandCgoFrames returns nil if pc could not be expanded.
767: traceback.go:1667 - runtime.callCgoSymbolizer
   └─ callCgoSymbolizer calls the cgoSymbolizer function.
768: string.go:370 - runtime.gostring
   └─ This is exported via linkname to assembly in syscall (for Plan9) and cgo. go:linkname gostring
769: string.go:318 - runtime.rawstring
   └─ rawstring allocates storage for a new string. The returned string and byte slice both refer to the same storage. The storage is not zeroed. Callers should use b to set the string contents and then drop b.
770: malloc.go:1014 - runtime.mallocgc
   └─ Allocate an object of size bytes. Small objects are allocated from the per-P cache's free lists. Large objects (> 32 kB) are allocated straight from the heap. mallocgc should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/gopkg - github.com/bytedance/sonic - github.com/cloudwego/frugal - github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach - github.com/cockroachdb/pebble - github.com/ugorji/go/codec Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname mallocgc
771: mfinal.go:97 - runtime.lockRankMayQueueFinalizer
   └─ lockRankMayQueueFinalizer records the lock ranking effects of a function that may call queuefinalizer.
772: malloc.go:1638 - runtime.preMallocgcDebug
773: malloc.go:2072 - runtime.redZoneSize
   └─ redZoneSize computes the size of the redzone for a given allocation. Refer to the implementation of the compiler-rt.
774: malloc.go:1698 - runtime.deductAssistCredit
   └─ deductAssistCredit reduces the current G's assist credit by size bytes, and assists the GC if necessary. Caller must be preemptible. Returns the G for which the assist credit was accounted.
775: mgcmark.go:441 - runtime.gcAssistAlloc
   └─ gcAssistAlloc performs GC work to make gp's assist debt positive. gp must be the calling user goroutine. This must be called with preemption enabled.
776: mgcmark.go:457 - runtime.gcAssistAlloc$1
777: mgclimit.go:90 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).limiting
   └─ limiting returns true if the CPU limiter is currently enabled, meaning the Go GC should take action to limit CPU utilization. It is safe to call concurrently with other operations.
778: types.go:436 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Float64).Load
   └─ Load accesses and returns the value atomically. go:nosplit
779: traceruntime.go:414 - (runtime.traceLocker).GCMarkAssistDone
   └─ GCMarkAssistDone emits a MarkAssistEnd event.
780: traceruntime.go:409 - (runtime.traceLocker).GCMarkAssistStart
   └─ GCMarkAssistStart emits a MarkAssistBegin event.
781: mgc.go:887 - runtime.gcMarkDone
   └─ gcMarkDone transitions the GC from mark to mark termination if all reachable objects have been marked (that is, there are no grey objects and can be no more in the future). Otherwise, it flushes all local work to the global queues where it can be discovered by other workers. This should be called when all local mark work has been drained and there are no remaining workers. Specifically, when work.nwait == work.nproc && !gcMarkWorkAvailable(p) The calling context must be preemptible. Flushing local work is important because idle Ps may have local work queued. This is the only way to make that work visible and drive GC to completion. It is explicitly okay to have write barriers in this function. If it does transition to mark termination, then all reachable objects have been marked, so the write barrier cannot shade any more objects.
782: proc.go:2100 - runtime.forEachP
   └─ forEachP calls fn(p) for every P p when p reaches a GC safe point. If a P is currently executing code, this will bring the P to a GC safe point and execute fn on that P. If the P is not executing code (it is idle or in a syscall), this will call fn(p) directly while preventing the P from exiting its state. This does not ensure that fn will run on every CPU executing Go code, but it acts as a global memory barrier. GC uses this as a "ragged barrier." The caller must hold worldsema. fn must not refer to any part of the current goroutine's stack, since the GC may move it.
783: mgc.go:1608 - runtime.gcMarkWorkAvailable
   └─ gcMarkWorkAvailable reports whether executing a mark worker on p is potentially useful. p may be nil, in which case it only checks the global sources of work.
784: lfstack.go:50 - (*runtime.lfstack).empty
785: mgcwork.go:369 - (*runtime.gcWork).empty
   └─ empty reports whether w has no mark work available. go:nowritebarrierrec
786: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:70 - (*runtime.localSpanQueue).empty
787: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:55 - (*runtime.spanQueue).empty
788: mstats.go:926 - (*runtime.cpuStats).accumulateGCPauseTime
   └─ accumulateGCPauseTime add dt*stwProcs to the GC CPU pause time stats. dt should be the actual time spent paused, for orthogonality. maxProcs should be GOMAXPROCS, not work.stwprocs, since this number must be comparable to a total time computed from GOMAXPROCS.
789: stack.go:1370 - runtime.gcComputeStartingStackSize
790: mgclimit.go:100 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).startGCTransition
   └─ startGCTransition notifies the limiter of a GC transition. This call takes ownership of the limiter and disables all other means of updating the limiter. Release ownership by calling finishGCTransition. It is safe to call concurrently with other operations.
791: mgclimit.go:300 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).tryLock
   └─ tryLock attempts to lock l. Returns true on success.
792: mgclimit.go:179 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).updateLocked
   └─ updateLocked is the implementation of update. l.lock must be held.
793: mgclimit.go:420 - (*runtime.limiterEvent).consume
   └─ consume acquires the partial event CPU time from any in-flight event. It achieves this by storing the current time as the new event time. Returns the type of the in-flight event, as well as how long it's currently been executing for. Returns limiterEventNone if no event is active.
794: mgclimit.go:369 - runtime.makeLimiterEventStamp
   └─ makeLimiterEventStamp creates a new stamp from the event type and the current timestamp.
795: mgclimit.go:264 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).accumulate
   └─ accumulate adds time to the bucket and signals whether the limiter is enabled. This is an internal function that deals just with the bucket. Prefer update. l.lock must be held.
796: mgcmark.go:736 - runtime.gcWakeAllAssists
   └─ gcWakeAllAssists wakes all currently blocked assists. This is used at the end of a GC cycle. gcBlackenEnabled must be false to prevent new assists from going to sleep after this point.
797: proc.go:7368 - (*runtime.gQueue).popList
   └─ popList takes all Gs in q and returns them as a gList.
798: proc.go:4019 - runtime.injectglist
   └─ injectglist adds each runnable G on the list to some run queue, and clears glist. If there is no current P, they are added to the global queue, and up to npidle M's are started to run them. Otherwise, for each idle P, this adds a G to the global queue and starts an M. Any remaining G's are added to the current P's local run queue. This may temporarily acquire sched.lock. Can run concurrently with GC.
799: proc.go:7382 - (*runtime.gList).empty
   └─ empty reports whether l is empty.
800: traceruntime.go:472 - (runtime.traceLocker).GoUnpark
   └─ GoUnpark emits a GoUnblock event.
801: traceruntime.go:493 - (runtime.traceLocker).emitUnblockStatus
   └─ emitUnblockStatus emits a GoStatus GoWaiting event for a goroutine about to be unblocked to the trace writer.
802: proc.go:6864 - runtime.globrunqputbatch
   └─ Put a batch of runnable goroutines on the global runnable queue. This clears *batch. sched.lock must be held. May run during STW, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrierrec
803: proc.go:7339 - (*runtime.gQueue).pushBackAll
   └─ pushBackAll adds all Gs in q2 to the tail of q. After this q2 must not be used.
804: proc.go:4043 - runtime.injectglist$1
805: proc.go:7355 - (*runtime.gQueue).pop
   └─ pop removes and returns the head of queue q. It returns nil if q is empty.
806: proc.go:7326 - (*runtime.gQueue).pushBack
   └─ pushBack adds gp to the tail of q.
807: proc.go:7311 - (*runtime.gQueue).empty
   └─ empty reports whether q is empty.
808: proc.go:7131 - runtime.runqputbatch
   └─ runqputbatch tries to put all the G's on q on the local runnable queue. If the local runq is full the input queue still contains unqueued Gs. Executed only by the owner P.
809: atomic_amd64.go:35 - atomic.LoadAcq
   └─ go:nosplit go:noinline
810: atomic_amd64.go:126 - atomic.StoreRel
   └─ go:noescape
811: proc.go:7146 - runtime.runqputbatch$1
812: mheap.go:2548 - runtime.gcWakeAllStrongFromWeak
   └─ gcWakeAllStrongFromWeak wakes all currently blocked weak->strong conversions. This is used at the end of a GC cycle. work.strongFromWeak.block must be false to prevent woken goroutines from immediately going back to sleep.
813: proc.go:6774 - runtime.schedEnableUser
   └─ schedEnableUser enables or disables the scheduling of user goroutines. This does not stop already running user goroutines, so the caller should first stop the world when disabling user goroutines.
814: mgcpacer.go:600 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).endCycle
   └─ endCycle computes the consMark estimate for the next cycle. userForced indicates whether the current GC cycle was forced by the application.
815: mgc.go:1037 - runtime.gcMarkTermination
   └─ World must be stopped and mark assists and background workers must be disabled.
816: mgc.go:255 - runtime.setGCPhase
   └─ go:nosplit
817: proc.go:1376 - runtime.casGToWaitingForSuspendG
   └─ casGToWaitingForSuspendG transitions gp from old to _Gwaiting, and sets the wait reason. The wait reason must be a valid isWaitingForSuspendG wait reason. Use this over casgstatus when possible to ensure that a waitreason is set.
818: proc.go:1366 - runtime.casGToWaiting
   └─ casGToWaiting transitions gp from old to _Gwaiting, and sets the wait reason. Use this over casgstatus when possible to ensure that a waitreason is set.
819: traceruntime.go:334 - (runtime.traceLocker).GCDone
   └─ GCDone traces a GCEnd event. Must be emitted by an actively running goroutine on an active P. This restriction can be changed easily and only depends on where it's currently called.
820: timeasm.go:14 - runtime.time_now
   └─ go:linkname time_now time.now
821: mstats.go:937 - (*runtime.cpuStats).accumulate
   └─ accumulate takes a cpuStats and adds in the current state of all GC CPU counters. gcMarkPhase indicates that we're in the mark phase and that certain counter values should be used.
822: mgcscavenge.go:1173 - (*runtime.scavengeIndex).nextGen
   └─ nextGen moves the scavenger forward one generation. Must be called once per GC cycle, but may be called more often to force more memory to be released. nextGen may only run concurrently with find.
823: mranges.go:165 - (runtime.offAddr).addr
   └─ addr returns the virtual address for this offset address.
824: mgclimit.go:122 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).finishGCTransition
   └─ finishGCTransition notifies the limiter that the GC transition is complete and releases ownership of it. It also accumulates STW time in the bucket. now must be the timestamp from the end of the STW pause.
825: mgclimit.go:305 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).unlock
   └─ unlock releases the lock on l. Must be called if tryLock returns true.
826: types.go:257 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uint32).Swap
   └─ Swap replaces u's value with new, returning u's value before the replacement. go:nosplit
827: mprof.go:372 - runtime.mProf_NextCycle
   └─ mProf_NextCycle publishes the next heap profile cycle and creates a fresh heap profile cycle. This operation is fast and can be done during STW. The caller must call mProf_Flush before calling mProf_NextCycle again. This is called by mark termination during STW so allocations and frees after the world is started again count towards a new heap profiling cycle.
828: mprof.go:212 - (*runtime.mProfCycleHolder).increment
   └─ increment increases the cycle count by one, wrapping the value at mProfCycleWrap. It clears the flushed flag.
829: mprof.go:383 - runtime.mProf_Flush
   └─ mProf_Flush flushes the events from the current heap profiling cycle into the active profile. After this it is safe to start a new heap profiling cycle with mProf_NextCycle. This is called by GC after mark termination starts the world. In contrast with mProf_NextCycle, this is somewhat expensive, but safe to do concurrently.
830: mprof.go:198 - (*runtime.mProfCycleHolder).setFlushed
   └─ setFlushed sets the flushed flag. It returns the current cycle count and the previous value of the flushed flag.
831: mprof.go:401 - runtime.mProf_FlushLocked
   └─ mProf_FlushLocked flushes the events from the heap profiling cycle at index into the active profile. The caller must hold the lock for the active profile (profMemActiveLock) and for the profiling cycle at index (profMemFutureLock[index]).
832: mprof.go:154 - (*runtime.memRecordCycle).add
   └─ add accumulates b into a. It does not zero b.
833: mgcwork.go:511 - runtime.prepareFreeWorkbufs
   └─ prepareFreeWorkbufs moves busy workbuf spans to free list so they can be freed to the heap. This must only be called when all workbufs are on the empty list.
834: mheap.go:1887 - (*runtime.mSpanList).takeAll
   └─ takeAll removes all spans from other and inserts them at the front of list.
835: mheap.go:1846 - (*runtime.mSpanList).isEmpty
836: mgc.go:1867 - runtime.itoaDiv
   └─ itoaDiv formats val/(10**dec) into buf.
837: mgc.go:1884 - runtime.fmtNSAsMS
   └─ fmtNSAsMS nicely formats ns nanoseconds as milliseconds.
838: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:88 - runtime.dumpScanStats
839: mfinal.go:184 - runtime.finReadQueueStats
840: mcleanup.go:611 - (*runtime.cleanupQueue).readQueueStats
841: arena.go:853 - (*runtime.mspan).setUserArenaChunkToFault
   └─ setUserArenaChunkToFault sets the address space for the user arena chunk to fault and releases any underlying memory resources. Must be in a non-preemptible state to ensure the consistency of statistics exported to MemStats.
842: mheap.go:593 - runtime.makeSpanClass
843: stubs.go:391 - runtime.bool2int
   └─ bool2int returns 0 if x is false or 1 if x is true.
844: mgcmark.go:747 - runtime.gcParkAssist
   └─ gcParkAssist puts the current goroutine on the assist queue and parks. gcParkAssist reports whether the assist is now satisfied. If it returns false, the caller must retry the assist.
845: malloc.go:1536 - runtime.mallocgcLarge
846: mcache.go:128 - runtime.getMCache
   └─ getMCache is a convenience function which tries to obtain an mcache. Returns nil if we're not bootstrapping or we don't have a P. The caller's P must not change, so we must be in a non-preemptible state.
847: mcache.go:221 - (*runtime.mcache).allocLarge
   └─ allocLarge allocates a span for a large object.
848: mgcsweep.go:912 - runtime.deductSweepCredit
   └─ deductSweepCredit deducts sweep credit for allocating a span of size spanBytes. This must be performed *before* the span is allocated to ensure the system has enough credit. If necessary, it performs sweeping to prevent going in to debt. If the caller will also sweep pages (e.g., for a large allocation), it can pass a non-zero callerSweepPages to leave that many pages unswept. deductSweepCredit makes a worst-case assumption that all spanBytes bytes of the ultimately allocated span will be available for object allocation. deductSweepCredit is the core of the "proportional sweep" system. It uses statistics gathered by the garbage collector to perform enough sweeping so that all pages are swept during the concurrent sweep phase between GC cycles. mheap_ must NOT be locked.
849: traceruntime.go:362 - (runtime.traceLocker).GCSweepStart
   └─ GCSweepStart prepares to trace a sweep loop. This does not emit any events until traceGCSweepSpan is called. GCSweepStart must be paired with traceGCSweepDone and there must be no preemption points between these two calls. Must be called with a valid P.
850: mgcsweep.go:358 - runtime.sweepone
   └─ sweepone sweeps some unswept heap span and returns the number of pages returned to the heap, or ^uintptr(0) if there was nothing to sweep.
851: mgcsweep.go:96 - (*runtime.mheap).nextSpanForSweep
   └─ nextSpanForSweep finds and pops the next span for sweeping from the central sweep buffers. It returns ownership of the span to the caller. Returns nil if no such span exists.
852: mgcsweep.go:63 - (*runtime.sweepClass).load
853: mgcsweep.go:89 - (runtime.sweepClass).split
   └─ split returns the underlying span class as well as whether we're interested in the full or partial unswept lists for that class, indicated as a boolean (true means "full").
854: mgcsweep.go:67 - (*runtime.sweepClass).update
855: mcentral.go:71 - (*runtime.mcentral).fullUnswept
   └─ fullUnswept returns the spanSet which holds unswept spans without any free slots for this sweepgen.
856: mspanset.go:150 - (*runtime.spanSet).pop
   └─ pop removes and returns a span from buffer b, or nil if b is empty. pop is safe to call concurrently with other pop and push operations.
857: mspanset.go:365 - (*runtime.atomicHeadTailIndex).load
   └─ load atomically reads a headTailIndex value.
858: mspanset.go:355 - (runtime.headTailIndex).split
   └─ split splits the headTailIndex value into its parts.
859: mspanset.go:340 - runtime.makeHeadTailIndex
   └─ makeHeadTailIndex creates a headTailIndex value from a separate head and tail.
860: mspanset.go:370 - (*runtime.atomicHeadTailIndex).cas
   └─ cas atomically compares-and-swaps a headTailIndex value.
861: mspanset.go:406 - (*runtime.atomicMSpanPointer).Load
   └─ Load returns the *mspan.
862: mspanset.go:329 - (*runtime.spanSetBlockAlloc).free
   └─ free returns a spanSetBlock back to the pool.
863: mcentral.go:59 - (*runtime.mcentral).partialUnswept
   └─ partialUnswept returns the spanSet which holds partially-filled unswept spans for this sweepgen.
864: mgcsweep.go:193 - (*runtime.activeSweep).markDrained
   └─ markDrained marks the active sweep cycle as having drained all remaining work. This is safe to be called concurrently with all other methods of activeSweep, though may race. Returns true if this call was the one that actually performed the mark.
865: mgcscavenge.go:429 - (*runtime.scavengerState).ready
   └─ ready signals to sysmon that the scavenger should be awoken.
866: traceruntime.go:396 - (runtime.traceLocker).GCSweepDone
   └─ GCSweepDone finishes tracing a sweep loop. If any memory was swept (i.e. traceGCSweepSpan emitted an event) then this will emit a GCSweepEnd event. Must be called with a valid P.
867: mheap.go:1006 - (*runtime.mheap).alloc
   └─ alloc allocates a new span of npage pages from the GC'd heap. spanclass indicates the span's size class and scannability. Returns a span that has been fully initialized. span.needzero indicates whether the span has been zeroed. Note that it may not be.
868: mbitmap.go:508 - (*runtime.mspan).initHeapBits
   └─ initHeapBits initializes the heap bitmap for a span.
869: mbitmap.go:537 - (*runtime.mspan).heapBits
   └─ heapBits returns the heap ptr/scalar bits stored at the end of the span for small object spans and heap arena spans. Note that the uintptr of each element means something different for small object spans and for heap arena spans. Small object spans are easy: they're never interpreted as anything but uintptr, so they're immune to differences in endianness. However, the heapBits for user arena spans is exposed through a dummy type descriptor, so the byte ordering needs to match the same byte ordering the compiler would emit. The compiler always emits the bitmap data in little endian byte ordering, so on big endian platforms these uintptrs will have their byte orders swapped from what they normally would be. heapBitsInSpan(span.elemsize) or span.isUserArenaChunk must be true. go:nosplit
870: mbitmap.go:561 - runtime.heapBitsSlice
   └─ Helper for constructing a slice for the span's heap bits. go:nosplit
871: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:24 - (*runtime.mspan).initInlineMarkBits
872: stubs.go:308 - runtime.publicationBarrier
   └─ publicationBarrier performs a store/store barrier (a "publication" or "export" barrier). Some form of synchronization is required between initializing an object and making that object accessible to another processor. Without synchronization, the initialization writes and the "publication" write may be reordered, allowing the other processor to follow the pointer and observe an uninitialized object. In general, higher-level synchronization should be used, such as locking or an atomic pointer write. publicationBarrier is for when those aren't an option, such as in the implementation of the memory manager. There's no corresponding barrier for the read side because the read side naturally has a data dependency order. All architectures that Go supports or seems likely to ever support automatically enforce data dependency ordering.
873: mgcmark.go:1769 - runtime.gcmarknewobject
   └─ gcmarknewobject marks a newly allocated object black. obj must not contain any non-nil pointers. This is nosplit so it can manipulate a gcWork without preemption. go:nowritebarrier go:nosplit
874: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:39 - (*runtime.mspan).scannedBitsForIndex
875: malloc.go:1828 - runtime.profilealloc
   └─ profilealloc resets the current mcache's nextSample counter and records a memory profile sample. The caller must be non-preemptible and have a P.
876: malloc.go:1845 - runtime.nextSample
   └─ nextSample returns the next sampling point for heap profiling. The goal is to sample allocations on average every MemProfileRate bytes, but with a completely random distribution over the allocation timeline; this corresponds to a Poisson process with parameter MemProfileRate. In Poisson processes, the distance between two samples follows the exponential distribution (exp(MemProfileRate)), so the best return value is a random number taken from an exponential distribution whose mean is MemProfileRate.
877: malloc.go:1859 - runtime.fastexprand
   └─ fastexprand returns a random number from an exponential distribution with the specified mean.
878: fastlog2.go:14 - runtime.fastlog2
   └─ fastlog2 implements a fast approximation to the base 2 log of a float64. This is used to compute a geometric distribution for heap sampling, without introducing dependencies into package math. This uses a very rough approximation using the float64 exponent and the first 25 bits of the mantissa. The top 5 bits of the mantissa are used to load limits from a table of constants and the rest are used to scale linearly between them.
879: float.go:52 - runtime.float64bits
   └─ float64bits returns the IEEE 754 binary representation of f.
880: mprof.go:437 - runtime.mProf_Malloc
   └─ Called by malloc to record a profiled block.
881: mgc.go:616 - (runtime.gcTrigger).test
   └─ test reports whether the trigger condition is satisfied, meaning that the exit condition for the _GCoff phase has been met. The exit condition should be tested when allocating.
882: mgcpacer.go:1131 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).trigger
   └─ trigger returns the current point at which a GC should trigger along with the heap goal. The returned value may be compared against heapLive to determine whether the GC should trigger. Thus, the GC trigger condition should be (but may not be, in the case of small movements for efficiency) checked whenever the heap goal may change.
883: mgc.go:643 - runtime.gcStart
   └─ gcStart starts the GC. It transitions from _GCoff to _GCmark (if debug.gcstoptheworld == 0) or performs all of GC (if debug.gcstoptheworld != 0). This may return without performing this transition in some cases, such as when called on a system stack or with locks held.
884: mgc.go:662 - runtime.gcStart$1
885: traceruntime.go:323 - (runtime.traceLocker).GCStart
   └─ GCStart traces a GCBegin event. Must be emitted by an actively running goroutine on an active P. This restriction can be changed easily and only depends on where it's currently called.
886: mgc.go:1350 - runtime.gcBgMarkStartWorkers
   └─ gcBgMarkStartWorkers prepares background mark worker goroutines. These goroutines will not run until the mark phase, but they must be started while the work is not stopped and from a regular G stack. The caller must hold worldsema.
887: mgc.go:1428 - runtime.gcBgMarkWorker
888: mgclimit.go:407 - (*runtime.limiterEvent).start
   └─ start begins tracking a new limiter event of the current type. If an event is already in flight, then a new event cannot begin because the current time is already being attributed to that event. In this case, this function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true. The caller must be non-preemptible until at least stop is called or this function returns false. Because this is trying to measure "on-CPU" time of some event, getting scheduled away during it can mean that whatever we're measuring isn't a reflection of "on-CPU" time. The OS could deschedule us at any time, but we want to maintain as close of an approximation as we can.
889: mgcpacer.go:880 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).markWorkerStop
   └─ markWorkerStop must be called whenever a mark worker stops executing. It updates mark work accounting in the controller by a duration of work in nanoseconds and other bookkeeping. Safe to execute at any time.
890: mgcpacer.go:1415 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).removeIdleMarkWorker
   └─ removeIdleMarkWorker must be called when a new idle mark worker stops executing.
891: mgc.go:1826 - runtime.clearpools
892: format.go:305 - tree.WithPlaceholderFormat$1
893: mgc.go:1780 - runtime.gcResetMarkState
   └─ gcResetMarkState resets global state prior to marking (concurrent or STW) and resets the stack scan state of all Gs. This is safe to do without the world stopped because any Gs created during or after this will start out in the reset state. gcResetMarkState must be called on the system stack because it acquires the heap lock. See mheap for details. go:systemstack
894: proc.go:729 - runtime.forEachG
   └─ forEachG calls fn on every G from allgs. forEachG takes a lock to exclude concurrent addition of new Gs.
895: proc.go:4304 - runtime.gosched_m
   └─ Gosched continuation on g0.
896: proc.go:4269 - runtime.goschedImpl
897: proc.go:941 - runtime.dumpgstatus
898: traceruntime.go:454 - (runtime.traceLocker).GoPreempt
   └─ GoPreempt emits a GoStop event with a GoPreempted reason.
899: traceruntime.go:459 - (runtime.traceLocker).GoStop
   └─ GoStop emits a GoStop event with the provided reason.
900: traceruntime.go:449 - (runtime.traceLocker).GoSched
   └─ GoSched emits a GoStop event with a GoSched reason.
901: proc.go:4202 - runtime.dropg
   └─ dropg removes the association between m and the current goroutine m->curg (gp for short). Typically a caller sets gp's status away from Grunning and then immediately calls dropg to finish the job. The caller is also responsible for arranging that gp will be restarted using ready at an appropriate time. After calling dropg and arranging for gp to be readied later, the caller can do other work but eventually should call schedule to restart the scheduling of goroutines on this m.
902: runtime2.go:293 - runtime.setMNoWB
   └─ setMNoWB performs *mp = new without a write barrier. For times when it's impractical to use an muintptr. go:nosplit go:nowritebarrier
903: runtime2.go:259 - runtime.setGNoWB
   └─ setGNoWB performs *gp = new without a write barrier. For times when it's impractical to use a guintptr. go:nosplit go:nowritebarrier
904: proc.go:6841 - runtime.globrunqput
   └─ Put gp on the global runnable queue. sched.lock must be held. May run during STW, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrierrec
905: proc.go:4109 - runtime.schedule
   └─ One round of scheduler: find a runnable goroutine and execute it. Never returns.
906: proc.go:3241 - runtime.stoplockedm
   └─ Stops execution of the current m that is locked to a g until the g is runnable again. Returns with acquired P.
907: proc.go:3122 - runtime.handoffp
   └─ Hands off P from syscall or locked M. Always runs without a P, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrierrec
908: trace.go:958 - runtime.traceReaderAvailable
   └─ traceReaderAvailable returns the trace reader if it is not currently scheduled and should be. Callers should first check that (traceEnabled() || traceShuttingDown()) is true.
909: mgc.go:914 - runtime.gcMarkDone$1
910: mwbbuf.go:195 - runtime.wbBufFlush1
   └─ wbBufFlush1 flushes p's write barrier buffer to the GC work queue. This must not have write barriers because it is part of the write barrier implementation, so this may lead to infinite loops or buffer corruption. This must be non-preemptible because it uses the P's workbuf. go:nowritebarrierrec go:systemstack
911: mgcmark.go:1644 - runtime.shade
   └─ Shade the object if it isn't already. The object is not nil and known to be in the heap. Preemption must be disabled. go:nowritebarrier
912: mwbbuf.go:78 - (*runtime.wbBuf).reset
   └─ reset empties b by resetting its next and end pointers.
913: mgcwork.go:214 - (*runtime.gcWork).putObjBatch
   └─ putObjBatch performs a put on every pointer in obj. See put for constraints on these pointers. go:nowritebarrierrec
914: mgcwork.go:302 - (*runtime.gcWork).dispose
   └─ dispose returns any cached pointers to the global queue. The buffers are being put on the full queue so that the write barriers will not simply reacquire them before the GC can inspect them. This helps reduce the mutator's ability to hide pointers during the concurrent mark phase. go:nowritebarrierrec
915: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:66 - (*runtime.localSpanQueue).drain
916: mgc.go:1227 - runtime.gcMarkTermination$4
917: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:107 - (*runtime.gcWork).flushScanStats
918: time.go:982 - (*runtime.timers).wakeTime
   └─ wakeTime looks at ts's timers and returns the time when we should wake up the netpoller. It returns 0 if there are no timers. This function is invoked when dropping a P, so it must run without any write barriers. go:nowritebarrierrec
919: proc.go:6939 - runtime.pidleput
   └─ pidleput puts p on the _Pidle list. now must be a relatively recent call to nanotime or zero. Returns now or the current time if now was zero. This releases ownership of p. Once sched.lock is released it is no longer safe to use p. sched.lock must be held. May run during STW, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrierrec
920: proc.go:3976 - runtime.wakeNetPoller
   └─ wakeNetPoller wakes up the thread sleeping in the network poller if it isn't going to wake up before the when argument; or it wakes an idle P to service timers and the network poller if there isn't one already.
921: netpoll_epoll.go:67 - runtime.netpollBreak
   └─ netpollBreak interrupts an epollwait.
922: proc.go:6079 - runtime.incidlelocked
923: proc.go:6091 - runtime.checkdead
   └─ Check for deadlock situation. The check is based on number of running M's, if 0 -> deadlock. sched.lock must be held.
924: time.go:1319 - runtime.timeSleepUntil
   └─ timeSleepUntil returns the time when the next timer should fire. Returns maxWhen if there are no timers. This is only called by sysmon and checkdead.
925: proc.go:1958 - runtime.mPark
   └─ mPark causes a thread to park itself, returning once woken. go:nosplit
926: lock_futex.go:35 - runtime.notesleep
927: lock_futex.go:22 - runtime.noteclear
   └─ One-time notifications.
928: proc.go:3322 - runtime.execute
   └─ Schedules gp to run on the current M. If inheritTime is true, gp inherits the remaining time in the current time slice. Otherwise, it starts a new time slice. Never returns. Write barriers are allowed because this is called immediately after acquiring a P in several places. go:yeswritebarrierrec
929: mprof.go:1426 - runtime.tryRecordGoroutineProfile
   └─ tryRecordGoroutineProfile ensures that gp1 has the appropriate representation in the current goroutine profile: either that it should not be profiled, or that a snapshot of its call stack and labels are now in the profile.
930: mprof.go:1293 - (*runtime.goroutineProfileStateHolder).Load
931: proc.go:2233 - runtime.runSafePointFn
   └─ runSafePointFn runs the safe point function, if any, for this P. This should be called like if getg().m.p.runSafePointFn != 0 { runSafePointFn() } runSafePointFn must be checked on any transition in to _Pidle or _Psyscall to avoid a race where forEachP sees that the P is running just before the P goes into _Pidle/_Psyscall and neither forEachP nor the P run the safe-point function.
932: forminfo.go:184 - norm.buildRecompMap
933: binary.go:176 - (encoding/binary.bigEndian).Uint32
   └─ Uint32 returns the uint32 representation of b[0:4].
934: parse.go:47 - language.Parse$1
935: parse.go:235 - language.Parse$1
936: mgc.go:751 - runtime.gcStart$3
937: mgcsweep.go:231 - runtime.finishsweep_m
   └─ finishsweep_m ensures that all spans are swept. The world must be stopped. This ensures there are no sweeps in progress. go:nowritebarrier
938: lockrank_off.go:68 - runtime.assertWorldStopped
   └─ go:nosplit
939: mgcsweep.go:206 - (*runtime.activeSweep).sweepers
   └─ sweepers returns the current number of active sweepers.
940: mspanset.go:239 - (*runtime.spanSet).reset
   └─ reset resets a spanSet which is empty. It will also clean up any left over blocks. Throws if the buf is not empty. reset may not be called concurrently with any other operations on the span set.
941: mspanset.go:396 - (*runtime.atomicHeadTailIndex).reset
   └─ reset clears the headTailIndex to (0, 0).
942: mgcscavenge.go:436 - (*runtime.scavengerState).wake
   └─ wake immediately unparks the scavenger if necessary. Safe to run without a P.
943: proc.go:7387 - (*runtime.gList).push
   └─ push adds gp to the head of l.
944: mheap.go:2995 - runtime.nextMarkBitArenaEpoch
   └─ nextMarkBitArenaEpoch establishes a new epoch for the arenas holding the mark bits. The arenas are named relative to the current GC cycle which is demarcated by the call to finishweep_m. All current spans have been swept. During that sweep each span allocated room for its gcmarkBits in gcBitsArenas.next block. gcBitsArenas.next becomes the gcBitsArenas.current where the GC will mark objects and after each span is swept these bits will be used to allocate objects. gcBitsArenas.current becomes gcBitsArenas.previous where the span's gcAllocBits live until all the spans have been swept during this GC cycle. The span's sweep extinguishes all the references to gcBitsArenas.previous by pointing gcAllocBits into the gcBitsArenas.current. The gcBitsArenas.previous is released to the gcBitsArenas.free list.

946: mgc.go:1523 - runtime.gcBgMarkWorker$2
947: mgcmark.go:1125 - runtime.gcDrainMarkWorkerDedicated
   └─ gcDrainMarkWorkerDedicated is a wrapper for gcDrain that exists to better account mark time in profiles.
948: mgcmark.go:1169 - runtime.gcDrain
   └─ gcDrain scans roots and objects in work buffers, blackening grey objects until it is unable to get more work. It may return before GC is done; it's the caller's responsibility to balance work from other Ps. If flags&gcDrainUntilPreempt != 0, gcDrain returns when g.preempt is set. If flags&gcDrainIdle != 0, gcDrain returns when there is other work to do. If flags&gcDrainFractional != 0, gcDrain self-preempts when pollFractionalWorkerExit() returns true. This implies gcDrainNoBlock. If flags&gcDrainFlushBgCredit != 0, gcDrain flushes scan work credit to gcController.bgScanCredit every gcCreditSlack units of scan work. gcDrain will always return if there is a pending STW or forEachP. Disabling write barriers is necessary to ensure that after we've confirmed that we've drained gcw, that we don't accidentally end up flipping that condition by immediately adding work in the form of a write barrier buffer flush. Don't set nowritebarrierrec because it's safe for some callees to have write barriers enabled. go:nowritebarrier
949: mgcmark.go:163 - runtime.markroot
   └─ markroot scans the i'th root. Preemption must be disabled (because this uses a gcWork). Returns the amount of GC work credit produced by the operation. If flushBgCredit is true, then that credit is also flushed to the background credit pool. nowritebarrier is only advisory here. go:nowritebarrier
950: mgcmark.go:272 - runtime.markrootBlock
   └─ markrootBlock scans the shard'th shard of the block of memory [b0, b0+n0), with the given pointer mask. Returns the amount of work done. go:nowritebarrier

   └─ gcScanCleanup scans the relevant parts of a cleanup special as a root.
954: mgcmark.go:788 - runtime.gcFlushBgCredit
   └─ gcFlushBgCredit flushes scanWork units of background scan work credit. This first satisfies blocked assists on the work.assistQueue and then flushes any remaining credit to gcController.bgScanCredit. Write barriers are disallowed because this is used by gcDrain after it has ensured that all work is drained and this must preserve that condition. go:nowritebarrierrec
955: proc.go:1103 - runtime.ready
   └─ Mark gp ready to run.
956: proc.go:7044 - runtime.runqput
   └─ runqput tries to put g on the local runnable queue. If next is false, runqput adds g to the tail of the runnable queue. If next is true, runqput puts g in the pp.runnext slot. If the run queue is full, runnext puts g on the global queue. Executed only by the owner P.

961: mgc.go:308 - runtime.pollFractionalWorkerExit
   └─ pollFractionalWorkerExit reports whether a fractional mark worker should self-preempt. It assumes it is called from the fractional worker.
962: proc.go:3778 - runtime.pollWork
   └─ pollWork reports whether there is non-background work this P could be doing. This is a fairly lightweight check to be used for background work loops, like idle GC. It checks a subset of the conditions checked by the actual scheduler.
963: netpoll.go:231 - runtime.netpollinited
964: netpoll_epoll.go:99 - runtime.netpoll
   └─ netpoll checks for ready network connections. Returns a list of goroutines that become runnable, and a delta to add to netpollWaiters. This must never return an empty list with a non-zero delta. delay < 0: blocks indefinitely delay == 0: does not block, just polls delay > 0: block for up to that many nanoseconds
965: syscall_linux.go:26 - syscall.EpollWait

   └─ setEventErr sets the result of pd.info().eventErr() to b. We only change the error bit if seq == 0 or if seq matches pollFDSeq (issue #59545).
968: netpoll.go:494 - runtime.netpollready
   └─ netpollready is called by the platform-specific netpoll function. It declares that the fd associated with pd is ready for I/O. The toRun argument is used to build a list of goroutines to return from netpoll. The mode argument is 'r', 'w', or 'r'+'w' to indicate whether the fd is ready for reading or writing or both. This returns a delta to apply to netpollWaiters. This may run while the world is stopped, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrier
969: netpoll.go:591 - runtime.netpollunblock
   └─ netpollunblock moves either pd.rg (if mode == 'r') or pd.wg (if mode == 'w') into the pdReady state. This returns any goroutine blocked on pd.{rg,wg}. It adds any adjustment to netpollWaiters to *delta; this adjustment should be applied after the goroutine has been marked ready.
970: types.go:400 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Uintptr).CompareAndSwap
   └─ CompareAndSwap atomically compares u's value with old, and if they're equal, swaps u's value with new. It reports whether the swap ran. go:nosplit

976: mgcmark_nogreenteagc.go:76 - (*runtime.gcWork).tryGetSpan
977: mgcwork.go:255 - (*runtime.gcWork).tryGetObj
   └─ tryGetObj dequeues a pointer for the garbage collector to trace. If there are no pointers remaining in this gcWork or in the global queue, tryGet returns 0.  Note that there may still be pointers in other gcWork instances or other caches. go:nowritebarrierrec

995: constant.go:97 - tree.canConstantBecome
   └─ canConstantBecome returns whether the provided Constant can become resolved as the provided type.
996: constant.go:502 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.StrVal).AvailableTypes
   └─ AvailableTypes implements the Constant interface. To fully take advantage of literal type inference, this method would determine exactly which types are available for a given string. This would entail attempting to parse the literal string as a date, a timestamp, an interval, etc. and having more fine-grained results than StrValAvailAllParsable. However, this is not feasible in practice because of the associated parsing overhead. Conservative approaches like checking the string's length have been investigated to reduce ambiguity and improve type inference in some cases. When doing so, the length of the string literal was compared against all valid date and timestamp formats to quickly gain limited insight into whether parsing the string as the respective datum types could succeed. The hope was to eliminate impossibilities and constrain the returned type sets as much as possible. Unfortunately, two issues were found with this approach: - date and timestamp formats do not always imply a fixed-length valid input. For instance, timestamp formats that take fractional seconds can successfully parse inputs of varied length. - the set of date and timestamp formats are not disjoint, which means that ambiguity can not be eliminated when inferring the type of string literals that use these shared formats. While these limitations still permitted improved type inference in many cases, they resulted in behavior that was ultimately incomplete, resulted in unpredictable levels of inference, and occasionally failed to eliminate ambiguity. Further heuristics could have been applied to improve the accuracy of the inference, like checking that all or some characters were digits, but it would not have circumvented the fundamental issues here. Fully parsing the literal into each type would be the only way to concretely avoid the issue of unpredictable inference behavior.
997: constant.go:267 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.NumVal).AvailableTypes

999: constant.go:199 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.NumVal).AsInt64
   └─ AsInt64 returns the value as a 64-bit integer if possible, or returns an error if not possible. The method will set expr.resInt to the value of this int64 if it is successful, avoiding the need to call the method again.
1000: constant.go:245 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.NumVal).AsConstantInt
   └─ AsConstantInt returns the value as an constant.Int if possible, along with a flag indicating whether the conversion was possible. The result contains the proper sign as per expr.negative.

   └─ low64 returns the least significant 64 bits of x.
1012: int.go:429 - (*math/big.Int).Int64

   └─ Num returns the numerator of x; it may be <= 0. The result is a reference to x's numerator; it may change if a new value is assigned to x, and vice versa. The sign of the numerator corresponds to the sign of x.
1019: rat.go:422 - (*math/big.Rat).Denom
   └─ Denom returns the denominator of x; it is always > 0. The result is a reference to x's denominator, unless x is an uninitialized (zero value) [Rat], in which case the result is a new [Int] of value 1. (To initialize x, any operation that sets x will do, including x.Set(x).) If the result is a reference to x's denominator it may change if a new value is assigned to x, and vice versa.
1020: value.go:355 - constant.smallInt
   └─ smallInt reports whether x would lead to "reasonably"-sized fraction if converted to a *big.Rat.

1027: float.go:164 - (*math/big.Float).SetPrec
   └─ SetPrec sets z's precision to prec and returns the (possibly) rounded value of z. Rounding occurs according to z's rounding mode if the mantissa cannot be represented in prec bits without loss of precision. SetPrec(0) maps all finite values to ±0; infinite values remain unchanged. If prec > [MaxPrec], it is set to [MaxPrec].
1028: float.go:190 - big.makeAcc
1029: float.go:398 - (*math/big.Float).round
   └─ round rounds z according to z.mode to z.prec bits and sets z.acc accordingly. sbit must be 0 or 1 and summarizes any "sticky bit" information one might have before calling round. z's mantissa must be normalized (with the msb set) or empty. CAUTION: The rounding modes [ToNegativeInf], [ToPositiveInf] are affected by the sign of z. For correct rounding, the sign of z must be set correctly before calling round.

1031: float.go:372 - (*math/big.Float).validate0
1032: ftoa.go:47 - (*math/big.Float).Text
   └─ Text converts the floating-point number x to a string according to the given format and precision prec. The format is one of: 'e'	-d.dddde±dd, decimal exponent, at least two (possibly 0) exponent digits 'E'	-d.ddddE±dd, decimal exponent, at least two (possibly 0) exponent digits 'f'	-ddddd.dddd, no exponent 'g'	like 'e' for large exponents, like 'f' otherwise 'G'	like 'E' for large exponents, like 'f' otherwise 'x'	-0xd.dddddp±dd, hexadecimal mantissa, decimal power of two exponent 'p'	-0x.dddp±dd, hexadecimal mantissa, decimal power of two exponent (non-standard) 'b'	-ddddddp±dd, decimal mantissa, decimal power of two exponent (non-standard) For the power-of-two exponent formats, the mantissa is printed in normalized form: 'x'	hexadecimal mantissa in [1, 2), or 0 'p'	hexadecimal mantissa in [½, 1), or 0 'b'	decimal integer mantissa using x.Prec() bits, or 0 Note that the 'x' form is the one used by most other languages and libraries. If format is a different character, Text returns a "%" followed by the unrecognized format character. The precision prec controls the number of digits (excluding the exponent) printed by the 'e', 'E', 'f', 'g', 'G', and 'x' formats. For 'e', 'E', 'f', and 'x', it is the number of digits after the decimal point. For 'g' and 'G' it is the total number of digits. A negative precision selects the smallest number of decimal digits necessary to identify the value x uniquely using x.Prec() mantissa bits. The prec value is ignored for the 'b' and 'p' formats.
1033: ftoa.go:63 - (*math/big.Float).Append

   └─ free returns the stack for use by another calculation.
1059: natconv.go:32 - big.maxPow
   └─ maxPow returns (b**n, n) such that b**n is the largest power b**n <= _M. For instance maxPow(10) == (1e19, 19) for 19 decimal digits in a 64bit Word. In other words, at most n digits in base b fit into a Word. TODO(gri) replace this with a table, generated at build time.
1060: natconv.go:496 - big.divisors

1063: nat.go:226 - big.alias
   └─ alias reports whether x and y share the same base array. Note: alias assumes that the capacity of underlying arrays is never changed for nat values; i.e. that there are no 3-operand slice expressions in this code (or worse, reflect-based operations to the same effect).

   └─ rem returns r such that r = u%v. It uses z as the storage for r.
1065: nat.go:302 - (*math/big.stack).save
   └─ save returns the current stack pointer. A future call to restore with the same value frees any temporaries allocated on the stack after the call to save.
1066: nat.go:313 - (*math/big.stack).restore
   └─ restore restores the stack pointer to n. It is almost always invoked as defer stk.restore(stk.save()) which makes sure to pop any temporaries allocated in the current function from the stack before returning.
1067: nat.go:318 - (*math/big.stack).nat
   └─ nat returns a nat of n words, allocated on the stack.
1068: natdiv.go:518 - (math/big.nat).div

   └─ Div returns the quotient and remainder of (hi, lo) divided by y: quo = (hi, lo)/y, rem = (hi, lo)%y with the dividend bits' upper half in parameter hi and the lower half in parameter lo. Div panics for y == 0 (division by zero) or y <= hi (quotient overflow).
1072: bits.go:505 - bits.Div32
   └─ Div32 returns the quotient and remainder of (hi, lo) divided by y: quo = (hi, lo)/y, rem = (hi, lo)%y with the dividend bits' upper half in parameter hi and the lower half in parameter lo. Div32 panics for y == 0 (division by zero) or y <= hi (quotient overflow).

   └─ Div64 returns the quotient and remainder of (hi, lo) divided by y: quo = (hi, lo)/y, rem = (hi, lo)%y with the dividend bits' upper half in parameter hi and the lower half in parameter lo. Div64 panics for y == 0 (division by zero) or y <= hi (quotient overflow).

   └─ div returns q, r such that q = ⌊uIn/vIn⌋ and r = uIn%vIn = uIn - q·vIn. It uses z and u as the storage for q and r. The caller must ensure that len(vIn) ≥ 2 (use divW otherwise) and that len(uIn) ≥ len(vIn) (the answer is 0, uIn otherwise).

1094: natdiv.go:727 - big.greaterThan
   └─ greaterThan reports whether the two digit numbers x1 x2 > y1 y2. TODO(rsc): In contradiction to most of this file, x1 is the high digit and x2 is the low digit. This should be fixed.
1095: arith_decl.go:37 - big.subVV

1097: natdiv.go:740 - (math/big.nat).divRecursive
   └─ divRecursive implements recursive division as described above. It overwrites z with ⌊u/v⌋ and overwrites u with the remainder r. z must be large enough to hold ⌊u/v⌋. This function is just for allocating and freeing temporaries around divRecursiveStep, the real implementation.
1098: natdiv.go:750 - (math/big.nat).divRecursiveStep [RECURSIVE]
   └─ divRecursiveStep is the actual implementation of recursive division. It adds ⌊u/v⌋ to z and overwrites u with the remainder r. z must be large enough to hold ⌊u/v⌋. It uses temps[depth] (allocating if needed) as a temporary live across the recursive call. It also uses tmp, but not live across the recursion.
1099: natmul.go:16 - (math/big.nat).mul [RECURSIVE]
   └─ mul sets z = x*y, using stk for temporary storage. The caller may pass stk == nil to request that mul obtain and release one itself.

   └─ mulAddWW returns z = x*y + r.
1101: natmul.go:151 - big.basicMul

   └─ Sub sets z to the difference x-y and returns z.
1105: nat.go:97 - (math/big.nat).add [RECURSIVE]
1106: arith.go:103 - big.addVW
   └─ addVW sets z = x + y, returning the final carry c. The behavior is undefined if len(x) != len(z). If len(z) == 0, c = y; otherwise, c is 0 or 1. addVW should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname.

1109: int.go:191 - (*math/big.Int).mul
   └─ mul is like Mul but takes an explicit stack to use, for internal use. It does not return a *Int because doing so makes the stack-allocated Ints used in natmul.go escape to the heap (even though the result is unused).
1110: natmul.go:73 - (math/big.nat).sqr
   └─ sqr sets z = x*x, using stk for temporary storage. The caller may pass stk == nil to request that sqr obtain and release one itself.
1111: natmul.go:113 - big.basicSqr
   └─ basicSqr sets z = x*x and is asymptotically faster than basicMul by about a factor of 2, but slower for small arguments due to overhead. Requirements: len(x) > 0, len(z) == 2*len(x) The (non-normalized) result is placed in z.
1112: natmul.go:257 - big.karatsubaSqr
   └─ karatsubaSqr squares x, writing the (non-normalized) result to z. z must have length 2*len(x). It is analogous to [karatsuba] but can run faster knowing both multiplicands are the same value.
1113: int.go:141 - (*math/big.Int).Add
   └─ Add sets z to the sum x+y and returns z.
1114: nat.go:233 - big.addTo
   └─ addTo implements z += x; z must be long enough. (we don't use nat.add because we need z to stay the same slice, and we don't need to normalize z after each addition)
1115: int.go:183 - (*math/big.Int).Mul
   └─ Mul sets z to the product x*y and returns z.
1116: natmul.go:353 - big.trace

   └─ ifmt returns the debug formatting of the Int x: 0xHEX.
1118: intconv.go:21 - (*math/big.Int).Text
   └─ Text returns the string representation of x in the given base. Base must be between 2 and 62, inclusive. The result uses the lower-case letters 'a' to 'z' for digit values 10 to 35, and the upper-case letters 'A' to 'Z' for digit values 36 to 61. No prefix (such as "0x") is added to the string. If x is a nil pointer it returns "<nil>".

1122: nat.go:378 - big.same
1123: nat.go:187 - (math/big.nat).montgomery
   └─ montgomery computes z mod m = x*y*2**(-n*_W) mod m, assuming k = -1/m mod 2**_W. z is used for storing the result which is returned; z must not alias x, y or m. See Gueron, "Efficient Software Implementations of Modular Exponentiation". https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/239.pdf In the terminology of that paper, this is an "Almost Montgomery Multiplication": x and y are required to satisfy 0 <= z < 2**(n*_W) and then the result z is guaranteed to satisfy 0 <= z < 2**(n*_W), but it may not be < m.
1124: nat.go:367 - (math/big.nat).isPow2
   └─ isPow2 returns i, true when x == 2**i and 0, false otherwise.
1125: nat.go:797 - (math/big.nat).expNNWindowed
   └─ expNNWindowed calculates x**y mod m using a fixed, 4-bit window, where m = 2**logM.
1126: nat.go:518 - (math/big.nat).trunc
   └─ trunc returns z = x mod 2ⁿ.
1127: nat.go:754 - (math/big.nat).expNNMontgomeryEven
   └─ expNNMontgomeryEven calculates x**y mod m where m = m1 × m2 for m1 = 2ⁿ and m2 odd. It uses two recursive calls to expNN for x**y mod m1 and x**y mod m2 and then uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine the results. The recursive call using m1 will use expNNWindowed, while the recursive call using m2 will use expNNMontgomery. For more details, see Ç. K. Koç, “Montgomery Reduction with Even Modulus”, IEE Proceedings: Computers and Digital Techniques, 141(5) 314-316, September 1994. http://www.people.vcu.edu/~jwang3/CMSC691/j34monex.pdf

   └─ subMod2N returns z = (x - y) mod 2ⁿ.
1131: int.go:918 - (math/big.nat).modInverse
1132: int.go:890 - (*math/big.Int).ModInverse
   └─ ModInverse sets z to the multiplicative inverse of g in the ring ℤ/nℤ and returns z. If g and n are not relatively prime, g has no multiplicative inverse in the ring ℤ/nℤ.  In this case, z is unchanged and the return value is nil. If n == 0, a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs.
1133: int.go:325 - (*math/big.Int).Mod
   └─ Mod sets z to the modulus x%y for y != 0 and returns z. If y == 0, a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs. Mod implements Euclidean modulus (unlike Go); see [Int.DivMod] for more details.
1134: int.go:299 - (*math/big.Int).QuoRem
   └─ QuoRem sets z to the quotient x/y and r to the remainder x%y and returns the pair (z, r) for y != 0. If y == 0, a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs. QuoRem implements T-division and modulus (like Go): q = x/y      with the result truncated to zero r = x - y*q (See Daan Leijen, “Division and Modulus for Computer Scientists”.) See [Int.DivMod] for Euclidean division and modulus (unlike Go).
1135: int.go:621 - (*math/big.Int).GCD
   └─ GCD sets z to the greatest common divisor of a and b and returns z. If x or y are not nil, GCD sets their value such that z = a*x + b*y. a and b may be positive, zero or negative. (Before Go 1.14 both had to be > 0.) Regardless of the signs of a and b, z is always >= 0. If a == b == 0, GCD sets z = x = y = 0. If a == 0 and b != 0, GCD sets z = |b|, x = 0, y = sign(b) * 1. If a != 0 and b == 0, GCD sets z = |a|, x = sign(a) * 1, y = 0.
1136: int.go:759 - (*math/big.Int).lehmerGCD
   └─ lehmerGCD sets z to the greatest common divisor of a and b, which both must be != 0, and returns z. If x or y are not nil, their values are set such that z = a*x + b*y. See Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2, Section 4.5.2, Algorithm L. This implementation uses the improved condition by Collins requiring only one quotient and avoiding the possibility of single Word overflow. See Jebelean, "Improving the multiprecision Euclidean algorithm", Design and Implementation of Symbolic Computation Systems, pp 45-58. The cosequences are updated according to Algorithm 10.45 from Cohen et al. "Handbook of Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography" pp 192.
1137: int.go:127 - (*math/big.Int).Abs

   └─ SetInt64 sets z to x and returns z.
1139: nat.go:79 - (math/big.nat).setUint64
1140: int.go:664 - big.lehmerSimulate
   └─ lehmerSimulate attempts to simulate several Euclidean update steps using the leading digits of A and B.  It returns u0, u1, v0, v1 such that A and B can be updated as: A = u0*A + v0*B B = u1*A + v1*B Requirements: A >= B and len(B.abs) >= 2 Since we are calculating with full words to avoid overflow, we use 'even' to track the sign of the cosequences. For even iterations: u0, v1 >= 0 && u1, v0 <= 0 For odd  iterations: u0, v1 <= 0 && u1, v0 >= 0
1141: int.go:717 - big.lehmerUpdate
   └─ lehmerUpdate updates the inputs A and B such that: A = u0*A + v0*B B = u1*A + v1*B where the signs of u0, u1, v0, v1 are given by even For even == true: u0, v1 >= 0 && u1, v0 <= 0 For even == false: u0, v1 <= 0 && u1, v0 >= 0 q, r, s, t are temporary variables to avoid allocations in the multiplication.
1142: int.go:728 - big.mulW
   └─ mulW sets z = x * (-?)w where the minus sign is present when neg is true.
1143: int.go:736 - big.euclidUpdate
   └─ euclidUpdate performs a single step of the Euclidean GCD algorithm if extended is true, it also updates the cosequence Ua, Ub. q and r are used as temporaries; the initial values are ignored.
1144: int.go:308 - (*math/big.Int).Div
   └─ Div sets z to the quotient x/y for y != 0 and returns z. If y == 0, a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs. Div implements Euclidean division (unlike Go); see [Int.DivMod] for more details.
1145: int.go:70 - (*math/big.Int).SetUint64
   └─ SetUint64 sets z to x and returns z.
1146: int.go:378 - (*math/big.Int).Cmp
   └─ Cmp compares x and y and returns: - -1 if x < y; - 0 if x == y; - +1 if x > y.
1147: natconv.go:405 - (math/big.nat).convertWords [RECURSIVE]
   └─ Convert words of q to base b digits in s. If q is large, it is recursively "split in half" by nat/nat division using tabulated divisors. Otherwise, it is converted iteratively using repeated nat/Word division. The iterative method processes n Words by n divW() calls, each of which visits every Word in the incrementally shortened q for a total of n + (n-1) + (n-2) ... + 2 + 1, or n(n+1)/2 divW()'s. Recursive conversion divides q by its approximate square root, yielding two parts, each half the size of q. Using the iterative method on both halves means 2 * (n/2)(n/2 + 1)/2 divW()'s plus the expensive long div(). Asymptotically, the ratio is favorable at 1/2 the divW()'s, and is made better by splitting the subblocks recursively. Best is to split blocks until one more split would take longer (because of the nat/nat div()) than the twice as many divW()'s of the iterative approach. This threshold is represented by leafSize. Benchmarking of leafSize in the range 2..64 shows that values of 8 and 16 work well, with a 4x speedup at medium lengths and ~30x for 20000 digits. Use nat_test.go's BenchmarkLeafSize tests to optimize leafSize for specific hardware.
1148: itoa.go:40 - strconv.AppendInt
   └─ AppendInt appends the string form of the integer i, as generated by [FormatInt], to dst and returns the extended buffer.
1149: itoa.go:59 - strconv.small
   └─ small returns the string for an i with 0 <= i < nSmalls.
1150: itoa.go:88 - strconv.formatBits
   └─ formatBits computes the string representation of u in the given base. If neg is set, u is treated as negative int64 value. If append_ is set, the string is appended to dst and the resulting byte slice is returned as the first result value; otherwise the string is returned as the second result value.
1151: itoa.go:197 - strconv.isPowerOfTwo
1152: ftoa.go:419 - (*math/big.Float).fmtP
   └─ fmtP appends the string of x in the format "0x." mantissa "p" exponent with a hexadecimal mantissa and a binary exponent, or "0" if x is zero, and returns the extended buffer. The mantissa is normalized such that 0.5 <= 0.mantissa < 1.0. The sign of x is ignored, and x must not be an Inf. (The caller handles Inf before invoking fmtP.)
1153: bytes.go:1073 - bytes.TrimRight
   └─ TrimRight returns a subslice of s by slicing off all trailing UTF-8-encoded code points that are contained in cutset.
1154: bytes.go:1086 - bytes.trimRightByte
1155: bytes.go:962 - bytes.makeASCIISet
   └─ makeASCIISet creates a set of ASCII characters and reports whether all characters in chars are ASCII.
1156: bytes.go:1093 - bytes.trimRightASCII

   └─ contains reports whether c is inside the set.
1158: bytes.go:1103 - bytes.trimRightUnicode
1159: utf8.go:253 - utf8.DecodeLastRune
   └─ DecodeLastRune unpacks the last UTF-8 encoding in p and returns the rune and its width in bytes. If p is empty it returns ([RuneError], 0). Otherwise, if the encoding is invalid, it returns (RuneError, 1). Both are impossible results for correct, non-empty UTF-8. An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value. No other validation is performed.
1160: utf8.go:431 - utf8.RuneStart
   └─ RuneStart reports whether the byte could be the first byte of an encoded, possibly invalid rune. Second and subsequent bytes always have the top two bits set to 10.
1161: utf8.go:157 - utf8.DecodeRune
   └─ DecodeRune unpacks the first UTF-8 encoding in p and returns the rune and its width in bytes. If p is empty it returns ([RuneError], 0). Otherwise, if the encoding is invalid, it returns (RuneError, 1). Both are impossible results for correct, non-empty UTF-8. An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value. No other validation is performed.
1162: bytes.go:981 - bytes.containsRune
   └─ containsRune is a simplified version of strings.ContainsRune to avoid importing the strings package. We avoid bytes.ContainsRune to avoid allocating a temporary copy of s.
1163: ftoa.go:352 - (*math/big.Float).fmtX
   └─ fmtX appends the string of x in the format "0x1." mantissa "p" exponent with a hexadecimal mantissa and a binary exponent, or "0x0p0" if x is zero, and returns the extended buffer. A non-zero mantissa is normalized such that 1.0 <= mantissa < 2.0. The sign of x is ignored, and x must not be an Inf. (The caller handles Inf before invoking fmtX.)
1164: float.go:215 - (*math/big.Float).MinPrec
   └─ MinPrec returns the minimum precision required to represent x exactly (i.e., the smallest prec before x.SetPrec(prec) would start rounding x). The result is 0 for |x| == 0 and |x| == Inf.
1165: float.go:200 - (*math/big.Float).SetMode
   └─ SetMode sets z's rounding mode to mode and returns an exact z. z remains unchanged otherwise. z.SetMode(z.Mode()) is a cheap way to set z's accuracy to [Exact].
1166: float.go:653 - (*math/big.Float).Set
   └─ Set sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z. If z's precision is 0, it is changed to the precision of x before setting z (and rounding will have no effect). Rounding is performed according to z's precision and rounding mode; and z's accuracy reports the result error relative to the exact (not rounded) result.
1167: decimal.go:55 - (*math/big.decimal).init
   └─ Init initializes x to the decimal representation of m << shift (for shift >= 0), or m >> -shift (for shift < 0).
1168: decimal.go:104 - big.rsh
   └─ rsh implements x >> s, for s <= maxShift.
1169: decimal.go:261 - big.trim
   └─ trim cuts off any trailing zeros from x's mantissa; they are meaningless for the value of x.
1170: ftoa.go:169 - big.roundShortest

1186: float.go:1635 - (*math/big.Float).Quo
   └─ Quo sets z to the rounded quotient x/y and returns z. Precision, rounding, and accuracy reporting are as for [Float.Add]. Quo panics with [ErrNaN] if both operands are zero or infinities. The value of z is undefined in that case.
1187: float.go:1340 - (*math/big.Float).uquo
   └─ z = x / y, ignoring signs of x and y for the division but using the sign of z for rounding the result. x and y must have a non-empty mantissa and valid exponent.

If a non-nil mant argument is provided its value is set to the mantissa of x, with the same precision and rounding mode as x. The components satisfy x == mant × 2**exp, with 0.5 <= |mant| < 1.0. Calling MantExp with a nil argument is an efficient way to get the exponent of the receiver. Special cases are: (  ±0).MantExp(mant) = 0, with mant set to   ±0 (±Inf).MantExp(mant) = 0, with mant set to ±Inf x and mant may be the same in which case x is set to its mantissa value.
1211: float.go:676 - (*math/big.Float).Copy
   └─ Copy sets z to x, with the same precision, rounding mode, and accuracy as x. Copy returns z. If x and z are identical, Copy is a no-op.
1212: float.go:1080 - (*math/big.Float).Int
   └─ Int returns the result of truncating x towards zero; or nil if x is an infinity. The result is [Exact] if x.IsInt(); otherwise it is [Below] for x > 0, and [Above] for x < 0. If a non-nil *[Int] argument z is provided, [Int] stores the result in z instead of allocating a new [Int].

1223: constant.go:133 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.NumVal).Kind
   └─ Kind implements the constant.Value interface.
1224: types.go:1416 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).Equivalent [RECURSIVE]
   └─ Equivalent returns true if this type is "equivalent" to the given type. Equivalent types are compatible with one another: they can be compared, assigned, and unioned. Equivalent types must always have the same type family for the root type and any descendant types (i.e. in case of array or tuple types). Types in the CollatedStringFamily must have the same locale. But other attributes of equivalent types, such as width, precision, and oid, can be different. Wildcard types (e.g. Any, AnyArray, AnyTuple, etc) have special equivalence behavior. AnyFamily types match any other type, including other AnyFamily types. And a wildcard collation (empty string) matches any other collation.
1225: types.go:880 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).Family
   └─ Family specifies a group of types that are compatible with one another. Types in the same family can be compared, assigned, etc., but may differ from one another in width, precision, locale, and other attributes. For example, it is always an error to insert an INT value into a FLOAT column, because they are not in the same family. However, values of different types within the same family are "insert-compatible" with one another. Insertion may still result in an error because of width overflow or other constraints, but it can at least be attempted. Families are convenient for performing type switches on types, because in most cases it is the type family that matters, not the specific type. For example, when CRDB encodes values, it maintains routines for each family, since types in the same family encode in very similar ways. Most type families have an associated "canonical type" that is the default representative of that family, and which is a superset of all other types in that family. Values with other types (in the same family) can always be trivially converted to the canonical type with no loss of information. For example, the canonical type for IntFamily is Int, which is a 64-bit integer. Both 32-bit and 16-bit integers can be trivially converted to it. Execution operators and functions are permissive in terms of input (allow any type within a given family), and typically return only values having canonical types as output. For example, the IntFamily Plus operator allows values having any IntFamily type as input. But then it will always convert those values to 64-bit integers, and return a final 64-bit integer value (types.Int). Doing this vastly reduces the required number of operator overloads.
1226: types.go:897 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).Locale
   └─ Locale identifies a specific geographical, political, or cultural region that impacts various character-based operations such as sorting, pattern matching, and builtin functions like lower and upper. It is only defined for the types in the CollatedStringFamily, and is the empty string for all other types.
1227: types.go:2019 - types.IsWildcardTupleType
   └─ IsWildcardTupleType returns true if this is the wildcard AnyTuple type. The wildcard type matches a tuple type having any number of fields (including 0).

1235: utilities.go:65 - errutil.NewWithDepthf
   └─ NewWithDepthf is like Newf() except the depth to capture the stack trace is configurable. See the doc of `New()` for more details.
1236: markers_print.go:65 - redact.HelperForErrorf
   └─ HelperForErrorf is a helper to implement a redaction-aware fmt.Errorf-compatible function in a different package. It formats the string according to the given format and arguments in the same way as Sprintf, but in addition to this if the format contains %w and an error object in the proper argument position it also returns that error object. Note: This function only works if an error redaction function has been injected with RegisterRedactErrorFn().

1247: print.go:944 - fmt.parseArgNumber
   └─ parseArgNumber returns the value of the bracketed number, minus 1 (explicit argument numbers are one-indexed but we want zero-indexed). The opening bracket is known to be present at format[0]. The returned values are the index, the number of bytes to consume up to the closing paren, if present, and whether the number parsed ok. The bytes to consume will be 1 if no closing paren is present.
1248: print.go:318 - fmt.parsenum
   └─ parsenum converts ASCII to integer.  num is 0 (and isnum is false) if no number present.

1336: quote.go:31 - strconv.appendQuotedWith
1337: utf8.go:205 - utf8.DecodeRuneInString
   └─ DecodeRuneInString is like [DecodeRune] but its input is a string. If s is empty it returns ([RuneError], 0). Otherwise, if the encoding is invalid, it returns (RuneError, 1). Both are impossible results for correct, non-empty UTF-8. An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value. No other validation is performed.
1338: quote.go:68 - strconv.appendEscapedRune
1339: quote.go:522 - strconv.IsPrint
   └─ IsPrint reports whether the rune is defined as printable by Go, with the same definition as [unicode.IsPrint]: letters, numbers, punctuation, symbols and ASCII space.
1340: quote.go:578 - strconv.isInGraphicList
   └─ isInGraphicList reports whether the rune is in the isGraphic list. This separation from IsGraphic allows quoteWith to avoid two calls to IsPrint. Should be called only if IsPrint fails.
1341: utf8.go:532 - utf8.ValidRune
   └─ ValidRune reports whether r can be legally encoded as UTF-8. Code points that are out of range or a surrogate half are illegal.

   └─ StripMarkers removes the redaction markers from the RedactableString. This returns an unsafe string where all safe and unsafe bits are mixed together.
1365: regexp.go:572 - (*regexp.Regexp).ReplaceAllString
   └─ ReplaceAllString returns a copy of src, replacing matches of the [Regexp] with the replacement string repl. Inside repl, $ signs are interpreted as in [Regexp.Expand].
1366: strings.go:62 - strings.Contains
   └─ Contains reports whether substr is within s.

1371: index_amd64.go:23 - bytealg.Cutover
   └─ Cutover reports the number of failures of IndexByte we should tolerate before switching over to Index. n is the number of bytes processed so far. See the bytes.Index implementation for details.
1372: regexp.go:603 - (*regexp.Regexp).replaceAll
1373: exec.go:521 - (*regexp.Regexp).doExecute
   └─ doExecute finds the leftmost match in the input, appends the position of its subexpressions to dstCap and returns dstCap. nil is returned if no matches are found and non-nil if matches are found.
1374: exec.go:397 - (*regexp.Regexp).doOnePass

   └─ IsWordChar reports whether r is considered a “word character” during the evaluation of the \b and \B zero-width assertions. These assertions are ASCII-only: the word characters are [A-Za-z0-9_].
1383: prog.go:195 - (*regexp/syntax.Inst).MatchRune
   └─ MatchRune reports whether the instruction matches (and consumes) r. It should only be called when i.Op == [InstRune].
1384: prog.go:204 - (*regexp/syntax.Inst).MatchRunePos
   └─ MatchRunePos checks whether the instruction matches (and consumes) r. If so, MatchRunePos returns the index of the matching rune pair (or, when len(i.Rune) == 1, rune singleton). If not, MatchRunePos returns -1. MatchRunePos should only be called when i.Op == [InstRune].
1385: letter.go:354 - unicode.SimpleFold
   └─ SimpleFold iterates over Unicode code points equivalent under the Unicode-defined simple case folding. Among the code points equivalent to rune (including rune itself), SimpleFold returns the smallest rune > r if one exists, or else the smallest rune >= 0. If r is not a valid Unicode code point, SimpleFold(r) returns r. For example: SimpleFold('A') = 'a' SimpleFold('a') = 'A' SimpleFold('K') = 'k' SimpleFold('k') = '\u212A' (Kelvin symbol, K) SimpleFold('\u212A') = 'K' SimpleFold('1') = '1' SimpleFold(-2) = -2
1386: letter.go:211 - unicode.lookupCaseRange
   └─ lookupCaseRange returns the CaseRange mapping for rune r or nil if no mapping exists for r.
1387: letter.go:231 - unicode.convertCase
   └─ convertCase converts r to _case using CaseRange cr.
1388: onepass.go:75 - regexp.onePassNext
   └─ onePassNext selects the next actionable state of the prog, based on the input character. It should only be called when i.Op == InstAlt or InstAltMatch, and from the one-pass machine. One of the alternates may ultimately lead without input to end of line. If the instruction is InstAltMatch the path to the InstMatch is in i.Out, the normal node in i.Next.

   └─ DecodeLastRuneInString is like [DecodeLastRune] but its input is a string. If s is empty it returns ([RuneError], 0). Otherwise, if the encoding is invalid, it returns (RuneError, 1). Both are impossible results for correct, non-empty UTF-8. An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value. No other validation is performed.

1403: buffer.go:379 - (*bytes.Buffer).ReadRune
   └─ ReadRune reads and returns the next UTF-8-encoded Unicode code point from the buffer. If no bytes are available, the error returned is io.EOF. If the bytes are an erroneous UTF-8 encoding, it consumes one byte and returns U+FFFD, 1.
1404: buffer.go:81 - (*bytes.Buffer).empty
   └─ empty reports whether the unread portion of the buffer is empty.
1405: buffer.go:112 - (*bytes.Buffer).Reset
   └─ Reset resets the buffer to be empty, but it retains the underlying storage for use by future writes. Reset is the same as [Buffer.Truncate](0).
1406: reader.go:87 - (*strings.Reader).ReadRune
   └─ ReadRune implements the [io.RuneReader] interface.

1412: backtrack.go:49 - regexp.newBitState
1413: backtrack.go:80 - (*regexp.bitState).reset
   └─ reset resets the state of the backtracker. end is the end position in the input. ncap is the number of captures.
1414: backtrack.go:138 - (*regexp.Regexp).tryBacktrack
   └─ tryBacktrack runs a backtracking search starting at pos.
1415: backtrack.go:129 - (*regexp.bitState).push
   └─ push pushes (pc, pos, arg) onto the job stack if it should be visited.
1416: backtrack.go:118 - (*regexp.bitState).shouldVisit

1426: exec.go:95 - (*regexp.machine).init
1427: exec.go:175 - (*regexp.machine).match
   └─ match runs the machine over the input starting at pos. It reports whether a match was found. If so, m.matchcap holds the submatch information.
1428: exec.go:246 - (*regexp.machine).clear
   └─ clear frees all threads on the thread queue.
1429: exec.go:260 - (*regexp.machine).step
   └─ step executes one step of the machine, running each of the threads on runq and appending new threads to nextq. The step processes the rune c (which may be endOfText), which starts at position pos and ends at nextPos. nextCond gives the setting for the empty-width flags after c.
1430: exec.go:317 - (*regexp.machine).add [RECURSIVE]
   └─ add adds an entry to q for pc, unless the q already has such an entry. It also recursively adds an entry for all instructions reachable from pc by following empty-width conditions satisfied by cond.  pos gives the current position in the input.
1431: exec.go:104 - (*regexp.machine).alloc
   └─ alloc allocates a new thread with the given instruction. It uses the free pool if possible.
1432: regexp.go:260 - (*regexp.Regexp).put
   └─ put returns a machine to the correct machine pool.

1434: parser.go:414 - sql.replaceColonsInIdentifiers$1
1435: regexp.go:310 - regexp.MustCompile
   └─ MustCompile is like [Compile] but panics if the expression cannot be parsed. It simplifies safe initialization of global variables holding compiled regular expressions.
1436: regexp.go:130 - regexp.Compile
   └─ Compile parses a regular expression and returns, if successful, a [Regexp] object that can be used to match against text. When matching against text, the regexp returns a match that begins as early as possible in the input (leftmost), and among those it chooses the one that a backtracking search would have found first. This so-called leftmost-first matching is the same semantics that Perl, Python, and other implementations use, although this package implements it without the expense of backtracking. For POSIX leftmost-longest matching, see [CompilePOSIX].
1437: regexp.go:167 - regexp.compile
1438: parse.go:887 - syntax.Parse
   └─ Parse parses a regular expression string s, controlled by the specified Flags, and returns a regular expression parse tree. The syntax is described in the top-level comment.

   └─ concat replaces the top of the stack (above the topmost '|' or '(') with its concatenation.
1444: parse.go:339 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).maybeConcat
   └─ maybeConcat implements incremental concatenation of literal runes into string nodes. The parser calls this before each push, so only the top fragment of the stack might need processing. Since this is called before a push, the topmost literal is no longer subject to operators like * (Otherwise ab* would turn into (ab)*.) If r >= 0 and there's a node left over, maybeConcat uses it to push r with the given flags. maybeConcat reports whether r was pushed.
1445: parse.go:154 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).reuse
1446: parse.go:141 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).newRegexp
1447: parse.go:293 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).push

1452: parse.go:273 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).calcHeight [RECURSIVE]
1453: parse.go:549 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).collapse
   └─ collapse returns the result of applying op to sub. If sub contains op nodes, they all get hoisted up so that there is never a concat of a concat or an alternate of an alternate.
1454: parse.go:589 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).factor
   └─ factor factors common prefixes from the alternation list sub. It returns a replacement list that reuses the same storage and frees (passes to p.reuse) any removed *Regexps. For example, ABC|ABD|AEF|BCX|BCY simplifies by literal prefix extraction to A(B(C|D)|EF)|BC(X|Y) which simplifies by character class introduction to A(B[CD]|EF)|BC[XY]
1455: parse.go:778 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).leadingString
   └─ leadingString returns the leading literal string that re begins with. The string refers to storage in re or its children.
1456: parse.go:790 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).removeLeadingString [RECURSIVE]
   └─ removeLeadingString removes the first n leading runes from the beginning of re. It returns the replacement for re.
1457: parse.go:827 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).leadingRegexp
   └─ leadingRegexp returns the leading regexp that re begins with. The regexp refers to storage in re or its children.
1458: parse.go:1302 - syntax.isCharClass
   └─ can this be represented as a character class? single-rune literal string, char class, ., and .|\n.
1459: regexp.go:64 - (*regexp/syntax.Regexp).Equal [RECURSIVE]
   └─ Equal reports whether x and y have identical structure.
1460: parse.go:844 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).removeLeadingRegexp
   └─ removeLeadingRegexp removes the leading regexp in re. It returns the replacement for re. If reuse is true, it passes the removed regexp (if no longer needed) to p.reuse.
1461: parse.go:1345 - syntax.mergeCharClass
   └─ mergeCharClass makes dst = dst|src. The caller must ensure that dst.Op >= src.Op, to reduce the amount of copying.
1462: parse.go:1310 - syntax.matchRune
   └─ does re match r?
1463: parse.go:1970 - syntax.appendLiteral
   └─ appendLiteral returns the result of appending the literal x to the class r.
1464: parse.go:2011 - syntax.appendFoldedRange
   └─ appendFoldedRange returns the result of appending the range lo-hi and its case folding-equivalent runes to the class r.
1465: parse.go:1978 - syntax.appendRange
   └─ appendRange returns the result of appending the range lo-hi to the class r.
1466: parse.go:2046 - syntax.appendClass
   └─ appendClass returns the result of appending the class x to the class r. It assume x is clean.
1467: parse.go:523 - syntax.cleanAlt
   └─ cleanAlt cleans re for eventual inclusion in an alternation.
1468: parse.go:1923 - syntax.cleanClass
   └─ cleanClass sorts the ranges (pairs of elements of r), merges them, and eliminates duplicates.
1469: sort.go:50 - sort.Sort
   └─ Sort sorts data in ascending order as determined by the Less method. It makes one call to data.Len to determine n and O(n*log(n)) calls to data.Less and data.Swap. The sort is not guaranteed to be stable. Note: in many situations, the newer [slices.SortFunc] function is more ergonomic and runs faster.
1470: sort.go:158 - (sort.StringSlice).Len
1471: privilege.go:75 - (github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/privilege.List).Len

1472: sort.go:43 - (golang.org/x/text/collate.sorter).Len
1473: zsortinterface.go:61 - sort.pdqsort [RECURSIVE]
   └─ pdqsort sorts data[a:b]. The algorithm based on pattern-defeating quicksort(pdqsort), but without the optimizations from BlockQuicksort. pdqsort paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05123.pdf C++ implementation: https://github.com/orlp/pdqsort Rust implementation: https://docs.rs/pdqsort/latest/pdqsort/ limit is the number of allowed bad (very unbalanced) pivots before falling back to heapsort.

1493: bytes.go:28 - bytes.Compare
   └─ Compare returns an integer comparing two byte slices lexicographically. The result will be 0 if a == b, -1 if a < b, and +1 if a > b. A nil argument is equivalent to an empty slice.

Use Compare when you need to perform a three-way comparison (with [slices.SortFunc], for example). It is usually clearer and always faster to use the built-in string comparison operators ==, <, >, and so on.

1508: value.go:215 - (reflect.flag).mustBe
   └─ mustBe panics if f's kind is not expected. Making this a method on flag instead of on Value (and embedding flag in Value) means that we can write the very clear v.mustBe(Bool) and have it compile into v.flag.mustBe(Bool), which will only bother to copy the single important word for the receiver.
1509: value.go:184 - reflect.valueMethodName
   └─ valueMethodName returns the name of the exported calling method on Value.
1510: extern.go:338 - runtime.Callers
   └─ Callers fills the slice pc with the return program counters of function invocations on the calling goroutine's stack. The argument skip is the number of stack frames to skip before recording in pc, with 0 identifying the frame for Callers itself and 1 identifying the caller of Callers. It returns the number of entries written to pc. To translate these PCs into symbolic information such as function names and line numbers, use [CallersFrames]. CallersFrames accounts for inlined functions and adjusts the return program counters into call program counters. Iterating over the returned slice of PCs directly is discouraged, as is using [FuncForPC] on any of the returned PCs, since these cannot account for inlining or return program counter adjustment.
1511: lib.go:915 - proto.mapKeys$4
1512: value.go:2414 - (reflect.Value).String
   └─ String returns the string v's underlying value, as a string. String is a special case because of Go's String method convention. Unlike the other getters, it does not panic if v's Kind is not [String]. Instead, it returns a string of the form "<T value>" where T is v's type. The fmt package treats Values specially. It does not call their String method implicitly but instead prints the concrete values they hold.

1522: sort.go:81 - fmtsort.compare [RECURSIVE]
   └─ compare compares two values of the same type. It returns -1, 0, 1 according to whether a > b (1), a == b (0), or a < b (-1). If the types differ, it returns -1. See the comment on Sort for the comparison rules.
1523: value.go:1368 - (reflect.Value).Float
   └─ Float returns v's underlying value, as a float64. It panics if v's Kind is not [Float32] or [Float64]
1524: sort.go:206 - fmtsort.floatCompare
   └─ floatCompare compares two floating-point values. NaNs compare low.
1525: sort.go:220 - fmtsort.isNaN
1526: value.go:1200 - (reflect.Value).Complex
   └─ Complex returns v's underlying value, as a complex128. It panics if v's Kind is not [Complex64] or [Complex128]
1527: value.go:2014 - (reflect.Value).Pointer
   └─ Pointer returns v's value as a uintptr. It panics if v's Kind is not [Chan], [Func], [Map], [Pointer], [Slice], [String], or [UnsafePointer]. If v's Kind is [Func], the returned pointer is an underlying code pointer, but not necessarily enough to identify a single function uniquely. The only guarantee is that the result is zero if and only if v is a nil func Value. If v's Kind is [Slice], the returned pointer is to the first element of the slice. If the slice is nil the returned value is 0.  If the slice is empty but non-nil the return value is non-zero. If v's Kind is [String], the returned pointer is to the first element of the underlying bytes of string. It's preferred to use uintptr(Value.UnsafePointer()) to get the equivalent result.
1528: value.go:3777 - reflect.escapes
   └─ Dummy annotation marking that the value x escapes, for use in cases where the reflect code is so clever that the compiler cannot follow.
1529: value.go:111 - (reflect.Value).pointer
   └─ pointer returns the underlying pointer represented by v. v.Kind() must be Pointer, Map, Chan, Func, or UnsafePointer if v.Kind() == Pointer, the base type must not be not-in-heap.
1530: value.go:3766 - reflect.verifyNotInHeapPtr
1531: sort.go:192 - fmtsort.nilCompare
   └─ nilCompare checks whether either value is nil. If not, the boolean is false. If either value is nil, the boolean is true and the integer is the comparison value. The comparison is defined to be 0 if both are nil, otherwise the one nil value compares low. Both arguments must represent a chan, func, interface, map, pointer, or slice.
1532: value.go:1259 - (reflect.Value).Field
   └─ Field returns the i'th field of the struct v. It panics if v's Kind is not [Struct] or i is out of range.
1533: type.go:556 - (*internal/abi.StructField).Embedded
1534: type.go:619 - (internal/abi.Name).IsEmbedded
   └─ IsEmbedded returns true iff n is embedded (an anonymous field).
1535: type.go:955 - reflect.add
   └─ add returns p+x. The whySafe string is ignored, so that the function still inlines as efficiently as p+x, but all call sites should use the string to record why the addition is safe, which is to say why the addition does not cause x to advance to the very end of p's allocation and therefore point incorrectly at the next block in memory. add should be an internal detail (and is trivially copyable), but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-go-agent - github.com/vmware/govmomi Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname add
1536: value.go:1928 - (reflect.Value).NumField
   └─ NumField returns the number of fields in the struct v. It panics if v's Kind is not [Struct].
1537: value.go:1383 - (reflect.Value).Index
   └─ Index returns v's i'th element. It panics if v's Kind is not [Array], [Slice], or [String] or i is out of range.
1538: value.go:89 - (reflect.flag).ro
1539: value.go:2651 - reflect.arrayAt
   └─ arrayAt returns the i-th element of p, an array whose elements are eltSize bytes wide. The array pointed at by p must have at least i+1 elements: it is invalid (but impossible to check here) to pass i >= len, because then the result will point outside the array. whySafe must explain why i < len. (Passing "i < len" is fine; the benefit is to surface this assumption at the call site.)
1540: value.go:1823 - (reflect.Value).Len
   └─ Len returns v's length. It panics if v's Kind is not [Array], [Chan], [Map], [Slice], [String], or pointer to [Array].

   └─ Elem returns the element type for t if t is an array, channel, map, pointer, or slice, otherwise nil.
1545: type.go:279 - (*internal/abi.Type).Len
   └─ Len returns the length of t if t is an array type, otherwise 0
1546: value.go:1215 - (reflect.Value).Elem
   └─ Elem returns the value that the interface v contains or that the pointer v points to. It panics if v's Kind is not [Interface] or [Pointer]. It returns the zero Value if v is nil.

1548: sort.go:68 - fmtsort.compare [RECURSIVE]
   └─ compare compares two values of the same type. It returns -1, 0, 1 according to whether a > b (1), a == b (0), or a < b (-1). If the types differ, it returns -1. See the comment on Sort for the comparison rules.
1549: sort.go:193 - fmtsort.floatCompare
   └─ floatCompare compares two floating-point values. NaNs compare low.
1550: sort.go:207 - fmtsort.isNaN
1551: sort.go:179 - fmtsort.nilCompare
   └─ nilCompare checks whether either value is nil. If not, the boolean is false. If either value is nil, the boolean is true and the integer is the comparison value. The comparison is defined to be 0 if both are nil, otherwise the one nil value compares low. Both arguments must represent a chan, func, interface, map, pointer, or slice.
1552: zsortinterface.go:38 - sort.heapSort
1553: zsortinterface.go:20 - sort.siftDown
   └─ siftDown implements the heap property on data[lo:hi]. first is an offset into the array where the root of the heap lies.
1554: zsortinterface.go:240 - sort.breakPatterns
   └─ breakPatterns scatters some elements around in an attempt to break some patterns that might cause imbalanced partitions in quicksort.

1556: sort.go:70 - (*sort.xorshift).Next
1557: zsortinterface.go:261 - sort.choosePivot
   └─ choosePivot chooses a pivot in data[a:b]. [0,8): chooses a static pivot. [8,shortestNinther): uses the simple median-of-three method. [shortestNinther,∞): uses the Tukey ninther method.
1558: zsortinterface.go:315 - sort.medianAdjacent
   └─ medianAdjacent finds the median of data[a - 1], data[a], data[a + 1] and stores the index into a.
1559: zsortinterface.go:307 - sort.median
   └─ median returns x where data[x] is the median of data[a],data[b],data[c], where x is a, b, or c.
1560: zsortinterface.go:298 - sort.order2
   └─ order2 returns x,y where data[x] <= data[y], where x,y=a,b or x,y=b,a.
1561: zsortinterface.go:319 - sort.reverseRange
1562: zsortinterface.go:195 - sort.partialInsertionSort
   └─ partialInsertionSort partially sorts a slice, returns true if the slice is sorted at the end.
1563: zsortinterface.go:173 - sort.partitionEqual
   └─ partitionEqual partitions data[a:b] into elements equal to data[pivot] followed by elements greater than data[pivot]. It assumed that data[a:b] does not contain elements smaller than the data[pivot].
1564: zsortinterface.go:135 - sort.partition
   └─ partition does one quicksort partition. Let p = data[pivot] Moves elements in data[a:b] around, so that data[i]<p and data[j]>=p for i<newpivot and j>newpivot. On return, data[newpivot] = p

1577: parse.go:1375 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).swapVerticalBar
   └─ If the top of the stack is an element followed by an opVerticalBar swapVerticalBar swaps the two and returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
1578: parse.go:1330 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parseVerticalBar
   └─ parseVerticalBar handles a | in the input.
1579: parse.go:394 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).op
   └─ op pushes a regexp with the given op onto the stack and returns that regexp.
1580: parse.go:1141 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parsePerlFlags
   └─ parsePerlFlags parses a Perl flag setting or non-capturing group or both, like (?i) or (?: or (?i:.  It removes the prefix from s and updates the parse state. The caller must have ensured that s begins with "(?".
1581: strings.go:127 - strings.IndexRune
   └─ IndexRune returns the index of the first instance of the Unicode code point r, or -1 if rune is not present in s. If r is [utf8.RuneError], it returns the first instance of any invalid UTF-8 byte sequence.
1582: strings.go:119 - strings.IndexByte
   └─ IndexByte returns the index of the first instance of c in s, or -1 if c is not present in s.
1583: parse.go:1260 - syntax.isValidCaptureName
   └─ isValidCaptureName reports whether name is a valid capture name: [A-Za-z0-9_]+. PCRE limits names to 32 bytes. Python rejects names starting with digits. We don't enforce either of those.

1587: parse.go:497 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).alternate
   └─ alternate replaces the top of the stack (above the topmost '(') with its alternation.
1588: parse.go:1827 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parseClass
   └─ parseClass parses a character class at the beginning of s and pushes it onto the parse stack.
1589: parse.go:1599 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parseNamedClass
   └─ parseNamedClass parses a leading POSIX named character class like [:alnum:] from the beginning of s. If one is present, it appends the characters to r and returns the new slice r and the remainder of the string.
1590: parse.go:1617 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).appendGroup
1591: parse.go:2054 - syntax.appendFoldedClass
   └─ appendFoldedClass returns the result of appending the case folding of the class x to the class r.
1592: parse.go:2063 - syntax.appendNegatedClass
   └─ appendNegatedClass returns the result of appending the negation of the class x to the class r. It assumes x is clean.
1593: parse.go:1751 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parseUnicodeClass
   └─ parseUnicodeClass parses a leading Unicode character class like \p{Han} from the beginning of s. If one is present, it appends the characters to r and returns the new slice r and the remainder of the string.
1594: parse.go:1715 - syntax.unicodeTable
   └─ unicodeTable returns the unicode.RangeTable identified by name and the table of additional fold-equivalent code points. If sign < 0, the result should be inverted.
1595: parse.go:1675 - syntax.canonicalName
   └─ canonicalName returns the canonical lookup string for name. The canonical name has a leading uppercase letter and then lowercase letters, and it omits all underscores, spaces, and hyphens. (We could have used all lowercase, but this way most package unicode map keys are already canonical.)
1596: parse.go:2079 - syntax.appendTable
   └─ appendTable returns the result of appending x to the class r.
1597: parse.go:2104 - syntax.appendNegatedTable
   └─ appendNegatedTable returns the result of appending the negation of x to the class r.
1598: parse.go:1585 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parsePerlClassEscape
   └─ parsePerlClassEscape parses a leading Perl character class escape like \d from the beginning of s. If one is present, it appends the characters to r and returns the new slice r and the remainder of the string.
1599: parse.go:1561 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parseClassChar
   └─ parseClassChar parses a character class character at the beginning of s and returns it.
1600: parse.go:1445 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parseEscape
   └─ parseEscape parses an escape sequence at the beginning of s and returns the rune.
1601: parse.go:2216 - syntax.unhex
1602: parse.go:2146 - syntax.negateClass
   └─ negateClass overwrites r and returns r's negation. It assumes the class r is already clean.
1603: parse.go:1102 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parseRepeat
   └─ parseRepeat parses {min} (max=min) or {min,} (max=-1) or {min,max}. If s is not of that form, it returns ok == false. If s has the right form but the values are too big, it returns min == -1, ok == true.
1604: parse.go:1273 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).parseInt
   └─ parseInt parses a decimal integer.
1605: parse.go:404 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).repeat
   └─ repeat replaces the top stack element with itself repeated according to op, min, max. before is the regexp suffix starting at the repetition operator. after is the regexp suffix following after the repetition operator. repeat returns an updated 'after' and an error, if any.
1606: parse.go:452 - syntax.repeatIsValid [RECURSIVE]
   └─ repeatIsValid reports whether the repetition re is valid. Valid means that the combination of the top-level repetition and any inner repetitions does not exceed n copies of the innermost thing. This function rewalks the regexp tree and is called for every repetition, so we have to worry about inducing quadratic behavior in the parser. We avoid this by only calling repeatIsValid when min or max >= 2. In that case the depth of any >= 2 nesting can only get to 9 without triggering a parse error, so each subtree can only be rewalked 9 times.
1607: parse.go:368 - (*regexp/syntax.parser).literal
   └─ literal pushes a literal regexp for the rune r on the stack.
1608: parse.go:380 - syntax.minFoldRune
   └─ minFoldRune returns the minimum rune fold-equivalent to r.
1609: strings.go:1285 - strings.Cut
   └─ Cut slices s around the first instance of sep, returning the text before and after sep. The found result reports whether sep appears in s. If sep does not appear in s, cut returns s, "", false.
1610: strings.go:108 - stringslite.Cut
1611: regexp.go:437 - (*regexp/syntax.Regexp).MaxCap [RECURSIVE]
   └─ MaxCap walks the regexp to find the maximum capture index.
1612: regexp.go:451 - (*regexp/syntax.Regexp).CapNames
   └─ CapNames walks the regexp to find the names of capturing groups.
1613: regexp.go:457 - (*regexp/syntax.Regexp).capNames [RECURSIVE]
1614: simplify.go:14 - (*regexp/syntax.Regexp).Simplify [RECURSIVE]
   └─ Simplify returns a regexp equivalent to re but without counted repetitions and with various other simplifications, such as rewriting /(?:a+)+/ to /a+/. The resulting regexp will execute correctly but its string representation will not produce the same parse tree, because capturing parentheses may have been duplicated or removed. For example, the simplified form for /(x){1,2}/ is /(x)(x)?/ but both parentheses capture as $1. The returned regexp may share structure with or be the original.
1615: simplify.go:134 - syntax.simplify1
   └─ simplify1 implements Simplify for the unary OpStar, OpPlus, and OpQuest operators. It returns the simple regexp equivalent to Regexp{Op: op, Flags: flags, Sub: {sub}} under the assumption that sub is already simple, and without first allocating that structure. If the regexp to be returned turns out to be equivalent to re, simplify1 returns re instead. simplify1 is factored out of Simplify because the implementation for other operators generates these unary expressions. Letting them call simplify1 makes sure the expressions they generate are simple.
1616: compile.go:71 - syntax.Compile
   └─ Compile compiles the regexp into a program to be executed. The regexp should have been simplified already (returned from re.Simplify).

1630: compile.go:238 - (*regexp/syntax.compiler).loop
   └─ loop returns the fragment for the main loop of a plus or star. For plus, it can be used after changing the entry to f1.i. For star, it can be used directly when f1 can't match an empty string. (When f1 can match an empty string, f1* must be implemented as (f1+)? to get the priority match order correct.)

1634: onepass.go:459 - regexp.compileOnePass
   └─ compileOnePass returns a new *syntax.Prog suitable for onePass execution if the original Prog can be recharacterized as a one-pass regexp program, or syntax.nil if the Prog cannot be converted. For a one pass prog, the fundamental condition that must be true is: at any InstAlt, there must be no ambiguity about what branch to  take.
1635: onepass.go:222 - regexp.onePassCopy
   └─ onePassCopy creates a copy of the original Prog, as we'll be modifying it.
1636: onepass.go:293 - regexp.makeOnePass
   └─ makeOnePass creates a onepass Prog, if possible. It is possible if at any alt, the match engine can always tell which branch to take. The routine may modify p if it is turned into a onepass Prog. If it isn't possible for this to be a onepass Prog, the Prog nil is returned. makeOnePass is recursive to the size of the Prog.

   └─ cleanupOnePass drops working memory, and restores certain shortcut instructions.
1649: prog.go:169 - (*regexp/syntax.Prog).StartCond
   └─ StartCond returns the leading empty-width conditions that must be true in any match. It returns ^EmptyOp(0) if no matches are possible.
1650: regexp.go:268 - regexp.minInputLen [RECURSIVE]
   └─ minInputLen walks the regexp to find the minimum length of any matchable input.
1651: utf8.go:321 - utf8.RuneLen
   └─ RuneLen returns the number of bytes in the UTF-8 encoding of the rune. It returns -1 if the rune is not a valid value to encode in UTF-8.
1652: prog.go:150 - (*regexp/syntax.Prog).Prefix
   └─ Prefix returns a literal string that all matches for the regexp must start with. Complete is true if the prefix is the entire match.
1653: prog.go:129 - (*regexp/syntax.Prog).skipNop
   └─ skipNop follows any no-op or capturing instructions.
1654: prog.go:138 - (*regexp/syntax.Inst).op
   └─ op returns i.Op but merges all the Rune special cases into InstRune
1655: builder.go:103 - (*strings.Builder).WriteRune
   └─ WriteRune appends the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode code point r to b's buffer. It returns the length of r and a nil error.
1656: builder.go:32 - (*strings.Builder).copyCheck
   └─ copyCheck implements a dynamic check to prevent modification after copying a non-zero Builder, which would be unsafe (see #25907, #47276). We cannot add a noCopy field to Builder, to cause vet's copylocks check to report copying, because copylocks cannot reliably discriminate the zero and nonzero cases.
1657: builder.go:46 - (*strings.Builder).String
   └─ String returns the accumulated string.
1658: backtrack.go:64 - regexp.maxBitStateLen
   └─ maxBitStateLen returns the maximum length of a string to search with the backtracker using prog.
1659: backtrack.go:73 - regexp.shouldBacktrack
   └─ shouldBacktrack reports whether the program is too long for the backtracker to run.
1660: onepass.go:41 - regexp.onePassPrefix
   └─ onePassPrefix returns a literal string that all matches for the regexp must start with. Complete is true if the prefix is the entire match. Pc is the index of the last rune instruction in the string. The onePassPrefix skips over the mandatory EmptyBeginText.

1706: regexp.go:587 - regexp.ReplaceAllLiteralString$1
1707: wrap.go:44 - errors.Is
   └─ Is reports whether any error in err's tree matches target. The tree consists of err itself, followed by the errors obtained by repeatedly calling its Unwrap() error or Unwrap() []error method. When err wraps multiple errors, Is examines err followed by a depth-first traversal of its children. An error is considered to match a target if it is equal to that target or if it implements a method Is(error) bool such that Is(target) returns true. An error type might provide an Is method so it can be treated as equivalent to an existing error. For example, if MyError defines func (m MyError) Is(target error) bool { return target == fs.ErrExist } then Is(MyError{}, fs.ErrExist) returns true. See [syscall.Errno.Is] for an example in the standard library. An Is method should only shallowly compare err and the target and not call [Unwrap] on either.
1708: type.go:386 - reflectlite.TypeOf
   └─ TypeOf returns the reflection Type that represents the dynamic type of i. If i is a nil interface value, TypeOf returns nil.
1709: type.go:638 - reflectlite.toType
   └─ toType converts from a *rtype to a Type that can be returned to the client of package reflect. In gc, the only concern is that a nil *rtype must be replaced by a nil Type, but in gccgo this function takes care of ensuring that multiple *rtype for the same type are coalesced into a single Type.

1734: buffer.go:121 - (*bytes.Buffer).tryGrowByReslice
   └─ tryGrowByReslice is an inlineable version of grow for the fast-case where the internal buffer only needs to be resliced. It returns the index where bytes should be written and whether it succeeded.
1735: buffer.go:132 - (*bytes.Buffer).grow
   └─ grow grows the buffer to guarantee space for n more bytes. It returns the index where bytes should be written. If the buffer can't grow it will panic with ErrTooLarge.

1769: composition.go:463 - (*golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm.reorderBuffer).compose
   └─ compose recombines the runes in the buffer. It should only be used to recompose a single segment, as it will not handle alternations between Hangul and non-Hangul characters correctly.
1770: composition.go:302 - (*golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm.reorderBuffer).bytesAt
   └─ bytesAt returns the UTF-8 encoding of the rune at position n. It is used for Hangul and recomposition.

   └─ insertCGJ inserts a Combining Grapheme Joiner (0x034f) into rb.
1787: normalize.go:182 - norm.appendQuick
1788: normalize.go:304 - (*golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm.formInfo).quickSpan
   └─ quickSpan returns a boundary n such that src[0:n] == f(src[0:n]) and whether any non-normalized parts were found. If atEOF is false, n will not point past the last segment if this segment might be become non-normalized by appending other runes.

1794: composition.go:218 - (*golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm.reorderBuffer).insertFlush
   └─ insertFlush inserts the given rune in the buffer ordered by CCC. If a decomposition with multiple segments are encountered, they leading ones are flushed. It returns a non-zero error code if the rune was not inserted.
1795: normalize.go:462 - norm.lastBoundary
1796: tabwriter.go:523 - (*text/tabwriter.Writer).Write

   └─ Reset the current state.
1799: tabwriter.go:111 - (*text/tabwriter.Writer).addLine
   └─ addLine adds a new line. flushed is a hint indicating whether the underlying writer was just flushed. If so, the previous line is not likely to be a good indicator of the new line's cells.
1800: tabwriter.go:410 - (*text/tabwriter.Writer).append
   └─ Append text to current cell.
1801: tabwriter.go:416 - (*text/tabwriter.Writer).updateWidth

1826: count_native.go:10 - bytealg.Count
   └─ go:noescape
1827: bytes.go:420 - bytes.SplitN
   └─ SplitN slices s into subslices separated by sep and returns a slice of the subslices between those separators. If sep is empty, SplitN splits after each UTF-8 sequence. The count determines the number of subslices to return: - n > 0: at most n subslices; the last subslice will be the unsplit remainder; - n == 0: the result is nil (zero subslices); - n < 0: all subslices. To split around the first instance of a separator, see [Cut].
1828: bytes.go:381 - bytes.genSplit
   └─ Generic split: splits after each instance of sep, including sepSave bytes of sep in the subslices.
1829: bytes.go:34 - bytes.explode
   └─ explode splits s into a slice of UTF-8 sequences, one per Unicode code point (still slices of bytes), up to a maximum of n byte slices. Invalid UTF-8 sequences are chopped into individual bytes.

1838: format_error.go:751 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/errbase.state).switchOver
1839: buffer.go:60 - (*bytes.Buffer).Bytes
   └─ Bytes returns a slice of length b.Len() holding the unread portion of the buffer. The slice is valid for use only until the next buffer modification (that is, only until the next call to a method like [Buffer.Read], [Buffer.Write], [Buffer.Reset], or [Buffer.Truncate]). The slice aliases the buffer content at least until the next buffer modification, so immediate changes to the slice will affect the result of future reads.
1840: pipe.go:160 - (*io.PipeWriter).Write
   └─ Write implements the standard Write interface: it writes data to the pipe, blocking until one or more readers have consumed all the data or the read end is closed. If the read end is closed with an error, that err is returned as err; otherwise err is [ErrClosedPipe].
1841: pipe.go:76 - (*io.pipe).write
1842: pipe.go:117 - (*io.pipe).writeCloseError
   └─ writeCloseError is considered internal to the pipe type.

   └─ Terminate escaped mode. If the escaped text was an HTML tag, its width is assumed to be zero for formatting purposes; if it was an HTML entity, its width is assumed to be one. In all other cases, the width is the unicode width of the text.
1848: tabwriter.go:430 - (*text/tabwriter.Writer).startEscape
   └─ Start escaped mode.
1849: print.go:260 - fmt.Fprint

1850: print.go:188 - (*fmt.pp).Flag
1851: print.go:186 - (*fmt.pp).Precision
1852: print.go:184 - (*fmt.pp).Width
1853: intconv.go:44 - big.writeMultiple
   └─ write count copies of text to s.

1855: print.go:178 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.pp).Precision
1856: print.go:176 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.pp).Width
1857: format.go:137 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).Format
   └─ Format implements fmt.Formatter. It accepts many of the regular formats for floating-point numbers ('e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', 'G') as well as 's' and 'v', which are handled like 'G'. Format also supports the output field width, as well as the format flags '+' and ' ' for sign control, '0' for space or zero padding, and '-' for left or right justification. It does not support precision. See the fmt package for details.
1858: format.go:41 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).Append
   └─ Append appends to buf the string form of the decimal number d, as generated by d.Text, and returns the extended buffer.
1859: format.go:86 - apd.fmtE
   └─ %e: d.ddddde±d
1860: format.go:106 - apd.fmtF
   └─ %f: ddddddd.ddddd
1861: format.go:35 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).String
   └─ String formats x like x.Text('G'). It matches the to-scientific-string conversion of the GDA spec.
1862: format.go:28 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).Text
   └─ Text converts the floating-point number x to a string according to the given format. The format is one of: 'e'	-d.dddde±dd, decimal exponent, exponent digits 'E'	-d.ddddE±dd, decimal exponent, exponent digits 'f'	-ddddd.dddd, no exponent 'g'	like 'e' for large exponents, like 'f' otherwise 'G'	like 'E' for large exponents, like 'f' otherwise If format is a different character, Text returns a "%" followed by the unrecognized.Format character. The 'f' format has the possibility of displaying precision that is not present in the Decimal when it appends zeros (the 'g' format avoids the use of 'f' in this case). All other formats always show the exact precision of the Decimal.
1863: format.go:201 - apd.writeMultiple
   └─ write count copies of text to s
1864: with_candidate_code.go:38 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/pgwire/pgerror.withCandidateCode).Format
1865: errbase_api.go:174 - errors.FormatError
   └─ FormatError formats an error according to s and verb. This is a helper meant for use when implementing the fmt.Formatter interface on custom error objects. If the error implements errors.Formatter, FormatError calls its FormatError method of f with an errors.Printer configured according to s and verb, and writes the result to s. Otherwise, if it is a wrapper, FormatError prints out its error prefix, then recurses on its cause. Otherwise, its Error() text is printed.
1866: format_error.go:50 - errbase.FormatError
   └─ FormatError formats an error according to s and verb. This is a helper meant for use when implementing the fmt.Formatter interface on custom error objects. If the error implements errors.Formatter, FormatError calls its FormatError method of f with an errors.Printer configured according to s and verb, and writes the result to s. Otherwise, if it is a wrapper, FormatError prints out its error prefix, then recurses on its cause. Otherwise, its Error() text is printed.
1867: format_error.go:87 - errbase.formatErrorInternal
   └─ formatErrorInternal is the shared logic between FormatError and FormatErrorRedactable. When the redactableOutput argument is true, the fmt.State argument is really a redact.SafePrinter and casted down as necessary. If verb and flags are not one of the supported error formatting combinations (in particular, %q, %#v etc), then the redactableOutput argument is ignored. This limitation may be lifted in a later version.
1868: format_error.go:332 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/errbase.state).formatRecursive [RECURSIVE]
   └─ formatRecursive performs a post-order traversal on the chain of errors to collect error details from innermost to outermost. It uses s.buf as an intermediate buffer to collect strings. It populates s.entries as a result. Between each layer of error, s.buf is reset. s.finalBuf is untouched. The conversion of s.entries to s.finalBuf is done by formatSingleLineOutput() and/or formatEntries().
1869: unwrap.go:30 - errbase.UnwrapOnce
   └─ UnwrapOnce accesses the direct cause of the error if any, otherwise returns nil. It supports both errors implementing causer (`Cause()` method, from github.com/pkg/errors) and `Wrapper` (`Unwrap()` method, from the Go 2 error proposal).

1884: markers.go:64 - (github.com/cockroachdb/redact.RedactableBytes).StripMarkers
   └─ StripMarkers removes the redaction markers from the RedactableBytes. This returns an unsafe string where all safe and unsafe bits are mixed together.
1885: regexp.go:671 - (*regexp.Regexp).ReplaceAll
   └─ ReplaceAll returns a copy of src, replacing matches of the [Regexp] with the replacement text repl. Inside repl, $ signs are interpreted as in [Regexp.Expand].

1889: format_error.go:847 - errbase.ElideSharedStackTraceSuffix
   └─ ElideSharedStackTraceSuffix removes the suffix of newStack that's already present in prevStack. The function returns true if some entries were elided.
1890: wrappers.go:40 - redact.Safe
   └─ Safe turns any value into an object that is considered as safe by the formatter. This is provided as an “escape hatch” for cases where the other interfaces and conventions fail. Increased usage of this mechanism should be taken as a signal that a new abstraction is missing. The implementation is also slow.
1891: markers_print.go:102 - redact.Fprint
   └─ Fprint is like Sprint but outputs the redactable string to the provided Writer.
1892: hooks.go:71 - fmt.DoPrint
   └─ DoPrint exposes the doPrint() method to the redact package.
1893: print.go:1166 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.pp).doPrint
1894: hooks.go:44 - fmt.Free
   └─ Free exposes pp deallocation to the redact package.
1895: print.go:158 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.pp).free
   └─ free saves used pp structs in ppFree; avoids an allocation per invocation.

1908: withstack.go:72 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/withstack.withStack).SafeFormatError
   └─ SafeFormatError implements the errbase.SafeFormatter interface.
1909: with_telemetry.go:45 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/telemetrykeys.withTelemetry).SafeFormatError
1910: strings.go:487 - strings.Join
   └─ Join concatenates the elements of its first argument to create a single string. The separator string sep is placed between elements in the resulting string.
1911: builder.go:75 - (*strings.Builder).Grow
   └─ Grow grows b's capacity, if necessary, to guarantee space for another n bytes. After Grow(n), at least n bytes can be written to b without another allocation. If n is negative, Grow panics.
1912: builder.go:66 - (*strings.Builder).grow
   └─ grow copies the buffer to a new, larger buffer so that there are at least n bytes of capacity beyond len(b.buf).
1913: bytealg.go:121 - bytealg.MakeNoZero
   └─ MakeNoZero makes a slice of length n and capacity of at least n Bytes without zeroing the bytes (including the bytes between len and cap). It is the caller's responsibility to ensure uninitialized bytes do not leak to the end user.
1914: builder.go:112 - (*strings.Builder).WriteString
   └─ WriteString appends the contents of s to b's buffer. It returns the length of s and a nil error.

1921: format_error.go:493 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/errbase.state).formatSimple
   └─ formatSimple performs a best effort at extracting the details at a given level of wrapping when the error object does not implement the Formatter interface.
1922: encode.go:165 - errbase.extractPrefix
   └─ extractPrefix extracts the prefix from a wrapper's error message. For example, err := errors.New("bar") err = errors.Wrap(err, "foo") extractPrefix(err) returns "foo".
1923: strings.go:525 - strings.HasSuffix
   └─ HasSuffix reports whether the string s ends with suffix.
1924: strings.go:20 - stringslite.HasSuffix
1925: errors.go:127 - (*github.com/pkg/errors.fundamental).Format
1926: io.go:314 - io.WriteString
   └─ WriteString writes the contents of the string s to w, which accepts a slice of bytes. If w implements [StringWriter], [StringWriter.WriteString] is invoked directly. Otherwise, [Writer.Write] is called exactly once.
1927: buffer.go:193 - (*bytes.Buffer).WriteString
   └─ WriteString appends the contents of s to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed. The return value n is the length of s; err is always nil. If the buffer becomes too large, WriteString will panic with [ErrTooLarge].
1928: xxhash_safe.go:9 - (*github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd/internal/xxhash.Digest).WriteString
   └─ WriteString adds more data to d. It always returns len(s), nil.
1929: file.go:319 - (*os.File).WriteString
   └─ WriteString is like Write, but writes the contents of string s rather than a slice of bytes.
1930: print.go:213 - (*fmt.pp).WriteString
   └─ WriteString implements [io.StringWriter] so that we can call [io.WriteString] on a pp (through state), for efficiency.
1931: bufio.go:750 - (*bufio.Writer).WriteString [RECURSIVE]
   └─ WriteString writes a string. It returns the number of bytes written. If the count is less than len(s), it also returns an error explaining why the write is short.
1932: print.go:205 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.pp).WriteString
   └─ Implement WriteString so that we can call io.WriteString on a pp (through state), for efficiency.

1934: stack.go:142 - (*github.com/pkg/errors.stack).Format
1935: stack.go:107 - (github.com/pkg/errors.StackTrace).Format
   └─ Format formats the stack of Frames according to the fmt.Formatter interface. %s	lists source files for each Frame in the stack %v	lists the source file and line number for each Frame in the stack Format accepts flags that alter the printing of some verbs, as follows: %+v   Prints filename, function, and line number for each Frame in the stack.
1936: stack.go:128 - (github.com/pkg/errors.StackTrace).formatSlice
   └─ formatSlice will format this StackTrace into the given buffer as a slice of Frame, only valid when called with '%s' or '%v'.
1937: stack.go:64 - (github.com/pkg/errors.Frame).Format [RECURSIVE]
   └─ Format formats the frame according to the fmt.Formatter interface. %s    source file %d    source line %n    function name %v    equivalent to %s:%d Format accepts flags that alter the printing of some verbs, as follows: %+s   function name and path of source file relative to the compile time GOPATH separated by \n\t (<funcname>\n\t<path>) %+v   equivalent to %+s:%d
1938: stack.go:34 - (github.com/pkg/errors.Frame).line
   └─ line returns the line number of source code of the function for this Frame's pc.
1939: stack.go:19 - (github.com/pkg/errors.Frame).pc
   └─ pc returns the program counter for this frame; multiple frames may have the same PC value.
1940: symtab.go:775 - runtime.FuncForPC
   └─ FuncForPC returns a *[Func] describing the function that contains the given program counter address, or else nil. If pc represents multiple functions because of inlining, it returns the *Func describing the innermost function, but with an entry of the outermost function.
1941: symtabinl.go:101 - (*runtime.inlineUnwinder).isInlined
   └─ isInlined returns whether uf is an inlined frame.
1942: symtabinl.go:138 - (*runtime.inlineUnwinder).fileLine
   └─ fileLine returns the file name and line number of the call within the given frame. As a convenience, for the innermost frame, it returns the file and line of the PC this unwinder was started at (often this is a call to another physical function). It returns "?", 0 if something goes wrong.
1943: symtab.go:1183 - runtime.funcline1
   └─ funcline1 should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/phuslu/log Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname funcline1
1944: symtab.go:1161 - runtime.funcfile
1945: symtab.go:972 - (runtime.srcFunc).name
   └─ name should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/phuslu/log Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401.
1946: symtab.go:828 - (*runtime.Func).FileLine
   └─ FileLine returns the file name and line number of the source code corresponding to the program counter pc. The result will not be accurate if pc is not a program counter within f.
1947: symtab.go:350 - (*runtime.Func).funcInfo
1948: stack.go:44 - (github.com/pkg/errors.Frame).name
   └─ name returns the name of this function, if known.
1949: symtab.go:802 - (*runtime.Func).Name
   └─ Name returns the name of the function.
1950: traceback.go:758 - runtime.funcNameForPrint
   └─ funcNameForPrint returns the function name for printing to the user.
1951: traceback.go:741 - runtime.funcNamePiecesForPrint
   └─ funcNamePiecesForPrint returns the function name for printing to the user. It returns three pieces so it doesn't need an allocation for string concatenation.
1952: stack.go:23 - (github.com/pkg/errors.Frame).file
   └─ file returns the full path to the file that contains the function for this Frame's pc.
1953: path.go:192 - path.Base
   └─ Base returns the last element of path. Trailing slashes are removed before extracting the last element. If the path is empty, Base returns ".". If the path consists entirely of slashes, Base returns "/".
1954: lastindexbyte_generic.go:16 - bytealg.LastIndexByteString
1955: stack.go:172 - errors.funcname
   └─ funcname removes the path prefix component of a function's name reported by func.Name().
1956: strings.go:82 - strings.LastIndex
   └─ LastIndex returns the index of the last instance of substr in s, or -1 if substr is not present in s.

1961: wrappers.go:56 - (github.com/cockroachdb/redact.safeWrapper).Format
   └─ Format implements the fmt.Formatter interface.
1962: make_format.go:24 - redact.reproducePrintf
1963: make_format.go:43 - redact.MakeFormat
   └─ MakeFormat is a helper for use by implementations of the SafeFormatter interface. It reproduces the format currently active in fmt.State and verb. This is provided because Go's standard fmt.State does not make the original format string available to us. If the return value justV is true, then the current state was found to be %v exactly; in that case the caller can avoid a full-blown Printf call and use just Print instead to take a shortcut.
1964: builder.go:95 - (*strings.Builder).WriteByte
   └─ WriteByte appends the byte c to b's buffer. The returned error is always nil.
1965: withstack.go:69 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/withstack.withStack).Format
   └─ Format implements the fmt.Formatter interface.
1966: stack.go:29 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/withstack.stack).Format

1971: errors.go:165 - (*github.com/pkg/errors.withStack).Format
1972: ftoa.go:458 - (*math/big.Float).Format
   └─ Format implements [fmt.Formatter]. It accepts all the regular formats for floating-point numbers ('b', 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', 'G', 'x') as well as 'p' and 'v'. See (*Float).Text for the interpretation of 'p'. The 'v' format is handled like 'g'. Format also supports specification of the minimum precision in digits, the output field width, as well as the format flags '+' and ' ' for sign control, '0' for space or zero padding, and '-' for left or right justification. See the fmt package for details.
1973: ftoa.go:57 - (*math/big.Float).String
   └─ String formats x like x.Text('g', 10). (String must be called explicitly, [Float.Format] does not support %s verb.)

   └─ NewWriter allocates and initializes a new [Writer]. The parameters are the same as for the Init function.
1991: tabwriter.go:209 - (*text/tabwriter.Writer).Init
   └─ A [Writer] must be initialized with a call to Init. The first parameter (output) specifies the filter output. The remaining parameters control the formatting: minwidth	minimal cell width including any padding tabwidth	width of tab characters (equivalent number of spaces) padding		padding added to a cell before computing its width padchar		ASCII char used for padding if padchar == '\t', the Writer will assume that the width of a '\t' in the formatted output is tabwidth, and cells are left-aligned independent of align_left (for correct-looking results, tabwidth must correspond to the tab width in the viewer displaying the result) flags		formatting control
1992: formatter.go:113 - (*github.com/kr/pretty.printer).printValue [RECURSIVE]
1993: value.go:1630 - (reflect.Value).IsValid
   └─ IsValid reports whether v represents a value. It returns false if v is the zero Value. If [Value.IsValid] returns false, all other methods except String panic. Most functions and methods never return an invalid Value. If one does, its documentation states the conditions explicitly.
1994: value.go:1458 - (reflect.Value).CanInterface
   └─ CanInterface reports whether [Value.Interface] can be used without panicking.

   └─ Add atomically adds delta to x and returns the new value.
2007: runtime.go:27 - sync.runtime_SemacquireRWMutexR
   └─ Semacquire(RW)Mutex(R) is like Semacquire, but for profiling contended Mutexes and RWMutexes. If lifo is true, queue waiter at the head of wait queue. skipframes is the number of frames to omit during tracing, counting from runtime_SemacquireMutex's caller. The different forms of this function just tell the runtime how to present the reason for waiting in a backtrace, and is used to compute some metrics. Otherwise they're functionally identical.
2008: rwmutex.go:114 - (*sync.RWMutex).RUnlock
   └─ RUnlock undoes a single [RWMutex.RLock] call; it does not affect other simultaneous readers. It is a run-time error if rw is not locked for reading on entry to RUnlock.
2009: rwmutex.go:129 - (*sync.RWMutex).rUnlockSlow
2010: runtime.go:59 - sync.fatal
2011: runtime.go:37 - sync.runtime_Semrelease
   └─ Semrelease atomically increments *s and notifies a waiting goroutine if one is blocked in Semacquire. It is intended as a simple wakeup primitive for use by the synchronization library and should not be used directly. If handoff is true, pass count directly to the first waiter. skipframes is the number of frames to omit during tracing, counting from runtime_Semrelease's caller.
2012: strings.go:361 - strings.Split
   └─ Split slices s into all substrings separated by sep and returns a slice of the substrings between those separators. If s does not contain sep and sep is not empty, Split returns a slice of length 1 whose only element is s. If sep is empty, Split splits after each UTF-8 sequence. If both s and sep are empty, Split returns an empty slice. It is equivalent to [SplitN] with a count of -1. To split around the first instance of a separator, see [Cut].
2013: strings.go:291 - strings.genSplit
   └─ Generic split: splits after each instance of sep, including sepSave bytes of sep in the subarrays.
2014: strings.go:23 - strings.explode
   └─ explode splits s into a slice of UTF-8 strings, one string per Unicode character up to a maximum of n (n < 0 means no limit). Invalid UTF-8 bytes are sliced individually.
2015: strings.go:42 - strings.Count
   └─ Count counts the number of non-overlapping instances of substr in s. If substr is an empty string, Count returns 1 + the number of Unicode code points in s.
2016: count_native.go:13 - bytealg.CountString
   └─ go:noescape
2017: atoi.go:243 - strconv.Atoi
   └─ Atoi is equivalent to ParseInt(s, 10, 0), converted to type int.
2018: atoi.go:197 - strconv.ParseInt
   └─ ParseInt interprets a string s in the given base (0, 2 to 36) and bit size (0 to 64) and returns the corresponding value i. The string may begin with a leading sign: "+" or "-". If the base argument is 0, the true base is implied by the string's prefix following the sign (if present): 2 for "0b", 8 for "0" or "0o", 16 for "0x", and 10 otherwise. Also, for argument base 0 only, underscore characters are permitted as defined by the Go syntax for [integer literals]. The bitSize argument specifies the integer type that the result must fit into. Bit sizes 0, 8, 16, 32, and 64 correspond to int, int8, int16, int32, and int64. If bitSize is below 0 or above 64, an error is returned. The errors that ParseInt returns have concrete type [*NumError] and include err.Num = s. If s is empty or contains invalid digits, err.Err = [ErrSyntax] and the returned value is 0; if the value corresponding to s cannot be represented by a signed integer of the given size, err.Err = [ErrRange] and the returned value is the maximum magnitude integer of the appropriate bitSize and sign.

2019: atoi.go:47 - strconv.syntaxError
2020: strings.go:143 - stringslite.Clone
2021: atoi.go:73 - strconv.ParseUint
   └─ ParseUint is like [ParseInt] but for unsigned numbers. A sign prefix is not permitted.
2022: atoi.go:55 - strconv.baseError
2023: atoi.go:16 - strconv.lower
   └─ lower(c) is a lower-case letter if and only if c is either that lower-case letter or the equivalent upper-case letter. Instead of writing c == 'x' || c == 'X' one can write lower(c) == 'x'. Note that lower of non-letters can produce other non-letters.
2024: atoi.go:59 - strconv.bitSizeError
2025: atoi.go:51 - strconv.rangeError
2026: atoi.go:283 - strconv.underscoreOK
   └─ underscoreOK reports whether the underscores in s are allowed. Checking them in this one function lets all the parsers skip over them simply. Underscore must appear only between digits or between a base prefix and a digit.
2027: table_marshal.go:528 - proto.wiretype
   └─ wiretype returns the wire encoding of the type.
2028: table_marshal.go:570 - proto.typeMarshaler
   └─ typeMarshaler returns the sizer and marshaler of a given field. t is the type of the field. tags is the generated "protobuf" tag of the field. If nozero is true, zero value is not marshaled to the wire. If oneof is true, it is a oneof field.

2031: type.go:737 - reflect.elem
2032: type.go:1337 - reflect.PtrTo
   └─ PtrTo returns the pointer type with element t. For example, if t represents type Foo, PtrTo(t) represents *Foo. PtrTo is the old spelling of [PointerTo]. The two functions behave identically. Deprecated: Superseded by [PointerTo]. go:fix inline
2033: type.go:1341 - reflect.PointerTo
   └─ PointerTo returns the pointer type with element t. For example, if t represents type Foo, PointerTo(t) represents *Foo.
2034: type.go:1345 - (*reflect.rtype).ptrTo
2035: type.go:1705 - reflect.typesByString
   └─ typesByString returns the subslice of typelinks() whose elements have the given string representation. It may be empty (no known types with that string) or may have multiple elements (multiple types with that string). typesByString should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/aristanetworks/goarista - fortio.org/log Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname typesByString
2036: type.go:1675 - reflect.typelinks
   └─ typelinks is implemented in package runtime. It returns a slice of the sections in each module, and a slice of *rtype offsets in each module. The types in each module are sorted by string. That is, the first two linked types of the first module are: d0 := sections[0] t1 := (*rtype)(add(d0, offset[0][0])) t2 := (*rtype)(add(d0, offset[0][1])) and t1.String() < t2.String() Note that strings are not unique identifiers for types: there can be more than one with a given string. Only types we might want to look up are included: pointers, channels, maps, slices, and arrays.
2037: type.go:1686 - reflect.rtypeOff
   └─ rtypeOff should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/goccy/go-json Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname rtypeOff
2038: type.go:1394 - reflect.fnv1

2299: type.go:1056 - (reflect.StructTag).Lookup
   └─ Lookup returns the value associated with key in the tag string. If the key is present in the tag the value (which may be empty) is returned. Otherwise the returned value will be the empty string. The ok return value reports whether the value was explicitly set in the tag string. If the tag does not have the conventional format, the value returned by Lookup is unspecified.
2300: quote.go:383 - strconv.Unquote
   └─ Unquote interprets s as a single-quoted, double-quoted, or backquoted Go string literal, returning the string value that s quotes.  (If s is single-quoted, it would be a Go character literal; Unquote returns the corresponding one-character string. For an empty character literal Unquote returns the empty string.)
2301: quote.go:395 - strconv.unquote
   └─ unquote parses a quoted string at the start of the input, returning the parsed prefix, the remaining suffix, and any parse errors. If unescape is true, the parsed prefix is unescaped, otherwise the input prefix is provided verbatim.

The second argument, quote, specifies the type of literal being parsed and therefore which escaped quote character is permitted. If set to a single quote, it permits the sequence \' and disallows unescaped '. If set to a double quote, it permits \" and disallows unescaped ". If set to zero, it does not permit either escape and allows both quote characters to appear unescaped.

   └─ Clone uses proto.Clone to return a deep copy of pb. It panics if pb recursively contains any instances of types which are known to be unsupported by proto.Clone. This function and its associated lint (see build/style_test.go) exist to ensure we do not attempt to proto.Clone types which are not supported by proto.Clone. This hackery is necessary because proto.Clone gives no direct indication that it has incompletely cloned a type; it merely logs to standard output (see https://github.com/golang/protobuf/blob/89238a3/proto/clone.go#L204). The concrete case against which this is currently guarding may be resolved upstream, see https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/issues/147.

   └─ getWithKey performs a lookup of key, returning a pointer to the version of the key in the map in addition to the element. This is relevant when multiple different key values compare equal (e.g., +0.0 and -0.0). When a grow occurs during iteration, iteration perform a lookup of keys from the old group in the new group in order to correctly expose updated elements. For NeedsKeyUpdate keys, iteration also must return the new key value, not the old key value. hash must be the hash of the key.

   └─ SetMapIndex sets the element associated with key in the map v to elem. It panics if v's Kind is not [Map]. If elem is the zero Value, SetMapIndex deletes the key from the map. Otherwise if v holds a nil map, SetMapIndex will panic. As in Go, key's elem must be assignable to the map's key type, and elem's value must be assignable to the map's elem type.

   └─ Copy copies the contents of src into dst until either dst has been filled or src has been exhausted. It returns the number of elements copied. Dst and src each must have kind [Slice] or [Array], and dst and src must have the same element type. It dst is an [Array], it panics if [Value.CanSet] returns false.

2599: extensions.go:157 - (*github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto.XXX_InternalExtensions).extensionsRead
   └─ extensionsRead returns the extensions map for read-only use.  It may be nil. The caller must hold the returned mutex's lock when accessing Elements within the map.
2600: message_set.go:135 - proto.skipVarint
2601: lib.go:324 - (*github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto.nonFatal).Merge
   └─ Merge merges err into nf and reports whether it was successful. Otherwise it returns false for any fatal non-nil errors.
2602: lib.go:310 - proto.isNonFatal
   └─ isNonFatal reports whether the error is either a RequiredNotSet error or a InvalidUTF8 error.
2603: lib.go:287 - (*github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto.RequiredNotSetError).RequiredNotSet
2604: lib.go:299 - (*github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto.invalidUTF8Error).InvalidUTF8
2605: sort.go:170 - sort.Ints
   └─ Ints sorts a slice of ints in increasing order. Note: as of Go 1.22, this function simply calls [slices.Sort].

2609: table_marshal_gogo.go:255 - proto.makeTimePtrSliceMarshaler$2
2610: timestamp.go:102 - proto.timestampProto
   └─ TimestampProto converts the time.Time to a google.protobuf.Timestamp proto. It returns an error if the resulting Timestamp is invalid.
2611: time.go:1428 - (time.Time).Unix
   └─ Unix returns t as a Unix time, the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 UTC. The result does not depend on the location associated with t. Unix-like operating systems often record time as a 32-bit count of seconds, but since the method here returns a 64-bit value it is valid for billions of years into the past or future.
2612: time.go:189 - (*time.Time).unixSec
   └─ unixSec returns the time's seconds since Jan 1 1970 (Unix time).
2613: time.go:1651 - time.Unix
   └─ Unix returns the local Time corresponding to the given Unix time, sec seconds and nsec nanoseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC. It is valid to pass nsec outside the range [0, 999999999]. Not all sec values have a corresponding time value. One such value is 1<<63-1 (the largest int64 value).
2614: time.go:1359 - time.unixTime
2615: time.go:1194 - (time.Time).Sub
   └─ Sub returns the duration t-u. If the result exceeds the maximum (or minimum) value that can be stored in a [Duration], the maximum (or minimum) duration will be returned. To compute t-d for a duration d, use t.Add(-d).
2616: time.go:1210 - time.subMono
2617: time.go:1166 - (time.Time).Add
   └─ Add returns the time t+d.
2618: time.go:192 - (*time.Time).addSec
   └─ addSec adds d seconds to the time.
2619: time.go:312 - (time.Time).Equal
   └─ Equal reports whether t and u represent the same time instant. Two times can be equal even if they are in different locations. For example, 6:00 +0200 and 4:00 UTC are Equal. See the documentation on the Time type for the pitfalls of using == with Time values; most code should use Equal instead.
2620: time.go:277 - (time.Time).Before
   └─ Before reports whether the time instant t is before u.
2621: timestamp.go:61 - proto.validateTimestamp
   └─ validateTimestamp determines whether a Timestamp is valid. A valid timestamp represents a time in the range [0001-01-01, 10000-01-01) and has a Nanos field in the range [0, 1e9). If the Timestamp is valid, validateTimestamp returns nil. Otherwise, it returns an error that describes the problem. Every valid Timestamp can be represented by a time.Time, but the converse is not true.
2622: table_marshal.go:2915 - proto.Size
   └─ Size returns the encoded size of a protocol buffer message. This is the main entry point.

For example if k represents int and e represents string, FuncOf([]Type{k}, []Type{e}, false) represents func(int) string. The variadic argument controls whether the function is variadic. FuncOf panics if the in[len(in)-1] does not represent a slice and variadic is true.
2825: type.go:1829 - reflect.initFuncTypes
2826: type.go:2598 - reflect.ArrayOf
   └─ ArrayOf returns the array type with the given length and element type. For example, if t represents int, ArrayOf(5, t) represents [5]int. If the resulting type would be larger than the available address space, ArrayOf panics.

2836: value.go:2570 - (reflect.Value).UnsafePointer
   └─ UnsafePointer returns v's value as a [unsafe.Pointer]. It panics if v's Kind is not [Chan], [Func], [Map], [Pointer], [Slice], [String] or [UnsafePointer]. If v's Kind is [Func], the returned pointer is an underlying code pointer, but not necessarily enough to identify a single function uniquely. The only guarantee is that the result is zero if and only if v is a nil func Value. If v's Kind is [Slice], the returned pointer is to the first element of the slice. If the slice is nil the returned value is nil.  If the slice is empty but non-nil the return value is non-nil. If v's Kind is [String], the returned pointer is to the first element of the underlying bytes of string.

2845: type.go:1952 - reflect.funcStr
   └─ funcStr builds a string representation of a funcType.
2846: type.go:1925 - reflect.FuncOf$1
2847: value.go:1872 - (reflect.Value).Method
   └─ Method returns a function value corresponding to v's i'th method. The arguments to a Call on the returned function should not include a receiver; the returned function will always use v as the receiver. Method panics if i is out of range or if v is a nil interface value. Calling this method will force the linker to retain all exported methods in all packages. This may make the executable binary larger but will not affect execution time.
2848: strings.go:1129 - strings.TrimPrefix
   └─ TrimPrefix returns s without the provided leading prefix string. If s doesn't start with prefix, s is returned unchanged.
2849: strings.go:129 - stringslite.TrimPrefix

Note that this function will be called once for each case in the oneof.
2851: value.go:362 - (reflect.Value).Call
   └─ Call calls the function v with the input arguments in. For example, if len(in) == 3, v.Call(in) represents the Go call v(in[0], in[1], in[2]). Call panics if v's Kind is not [Func]. It returns the output results as Values. As in Go, each input argument must be assignable to the type of the function's corresponding input parameter. If v is a variadic function, Call creates the variadic slice parameter itself, copying in the corresponding values.

2876: ftoa.go:49 - strconv.FormatFloat
   └─ FormatFloat converts the floating-point number f to a string, according to the format fmt and precision prec. It rounds the result assuming that the original was obtained from a floating-point value of bitSize bits (32 for float32, 64 for float64). The format fmt is one of - 'b' (-ddddp±ddd, a binary exponent), - 'e' (-d.dddde±dd, a decimal exponent), - 'E' (-d.ddddE±dd, a decimal exponent), - 'f' (-ddd.dddd, no exponent), - 'g' ('e' for large exponents, 'f' otherwise), - 'G' ('E' for large exponents, 'f' otherwise), - 'x' (-0xd.ddddp±ddd, a hexadecimal fraction and binary exponent), or - 'X' (-0Xd.ddddP±ddd, a hexadecimal fraction and binary exponent). The precision prec controls the number of digits (excluding the exponent) printed by the 'e', 'E', 'f', 'g', 'G', 'x', and 'X' formats. For 'e', 'E', 'f', 'x', and 'X', it is the number of digits after the decimal point. For 'g' and 'G' it is the maximum number of significant digits (trailing zeros are removed). The special precision -1 uses the smallest number of digits necessary such that ParseFloat will return f exactly. The exponent is written as a decimal integer; for all formats other than 'b', it will be at least two digits.

2999: eval.go:4327 - tree.arrayOfType
   └─ arrayOfType returns a fresh DArray of the input type.
3000: types.go:1974 - types.CheckArrayElementType
   └─ CheckArrayElementType ensures that the given type can be used as the element type of an ArrayFamily-typed column. If not, it returns an error.
3001: types.go:1963 - types.IsValidArrayElementType
   └─ IsValidArrayElementType returns true if the given type can be used as the element type of an ArrayFamily-typed column. If the valid return is false, the issue number should be included in the error report to inform the user.
3002: types.go:1875 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).String [RECURSIVE]
   └─ String returns the name of the type, similar to the Name method. However, it expands CollatedStringFamily, ArrayFamily, and TupleFamily types to be more descriptive. TODO(andyk): It'd be nice to have this return SqlString() method output, since that is more descriptive.
3003: types.go:994 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).Name [RECURSIVE]
   └─ Name returns a single word description of the type that describes it succinctly, but without all the details, such as width, locale, etc. The name is sometimes the same as the name returned by SQLStandardName, but is more CRDB friendly. TODO(andyk): Should these be changed to be the same as SQLStandardName?
3004: types.go:1113 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).SQLStandardName
   └─ SQLStandardName returns the type's name as it is specified in the SQL standard (or by Postgres for any non-standard types). This can be looked up for any type in Postgres using a query similar to this: SELECT format_type(pg_typeof(1::int)::regtype, NULL)
3005: types.go:1137 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).SQLStandardNameWithTypmod
   └─ SQLStandardNameWithTypmod is like SQLStandardName but it also accepts a typmod argument, and a boolean which indicates whether or not a typmod was even specified. The expected results of this function should be, in Postgres: SELECT format_type('thetype'::regype, typmod) Generally, what this does with a non-0 typmod is append the scale, precision or length of a datatype to the name of the datatype. For example, a varchar(20) would appear as character varying(20) when provided the typmod value for varchar(20), which happens to be 24. This function is full of special cases. See backend/utils/adt/format_type.c in Postgres.
3006: safedetails_api.go:50 - errors.Safe
   └─ Safe wraps the given object into an opaque struct that implements SafeMessager: its contents can be included as-is in PII-free strings in error objects and reports. NB: this is obsolete. Use redact.Safe instead.
3007: safedetails.go:62 - safedetails.Safe
   └─ Safe wraps the given object into an opaque struct that implements SafeMessager: its contents can be included as-is in PII-free strings in error objects and reports. NB: this is obsolete. Use redact.Safe instead.
3008: buffer.go:72 - (*bytes.Buffer).String
   └─ String returns the contents of the unread portion of the buffer as a string. If the [Buffer] is a nil pointer, it returns "<nil>". To build strings more efficiently, see the [strings.Builder] type.
3009: types.go:984 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).TupleLabels
   └─ TupleLabels returns a slice containing the labels of each tuple field. This is nil for types not in the TupleFamily, or if the tuple type does not specify labels.

   └─ UnimplementedErrorf creates a new leaf error that indicates that some feature was not (yet) implemented. The message is formatted.
3015: safedetails_api.go:35 - errors.WithSafeDetails
   └─ WithSafeDetails annotates an error with the given reportable details. The format is made available as a PII-free string, alongside with a PII-free representation of every additional argument. Arguments can be reported as-is (without redaction) by wrapping them using the Safe() function. If the format is empty and there are no arguments, the error argument is returned unchanged. Detail is shown: - via `errors.GetSafeDetails()` - when formatting with `%+v`. - in Sentry reports.
3016: safedetails.go:36 - safedetails.WithSafeDetails
   └─ WithSafeDetails annotates an error with the given reportable details. The format is made available as a PII-free string, alongside with a PII-free representation of every additional argument. Arguments can be reported as-is (without redaction) by wrapping them using the Safe() function. If the format is empty and there are no arguments, the error argument is returned unchanged. Detail is shown: - via `errors.GetSafeDetails()` - when formatting with `%+v`. - in Sentry reports.
3017: markers_print.go:46 - redact.Sprintf
   └─ Sprintf formats the arguments and encloses unsafe bits between redaction markers. If either safe and unsafe bits of data contain the markers in their representation already, they are escaped first. The format is always considered safe and the caller is responsible to ensure that the markers are not present in the format string.
3018: markers.go:38 - (github.com/cockroachdb/redact.RedactableString).Redact
   └─ Redact replaces all occurrences of unsafe substrings by the “Redacted” marker, ‹×›. The result string is still safe.

   └─ GetPGCode retrieves the error code for an error.
3071: pgcode.go:73 - pgerror.GetPGCodeInternal [RECURSIVE]
   └─ GetPGCodeInternal retrieves a code for the error. It operates by combining the inner (cause) code and the code at the current level, at each level of cause. - at each level: - if there is a candidate code at that level, that is used; - otherwise, it calls computeDefaultCode(). if the function returns an empty string, UncategorizedError is used. An example implementation for computeDefaultCode is provided below. - after that, it combines the code computed already for the cause (inner) and the new code just computed at the current level (outer) as follows: - if the outer code is uncategorized, the inner code is kept no matter what. - if the outer code has the special XX prefix, that is kept. (The "XX" prefix signals importance in the pg code hierarchy.) - if the inner code is not uncategorized, it is retained. - otherwise the outer code is retained.
3072: errbase_api.go:30 - errors.UnwrapOnce

3086: datum.go:627 - tree.AsDInt [RECURSIVE]
   └─ AsDInt attempts to retrieve a DInt from an Expr, returning a DInt and a flag signifying whether the assertion was successful. The function should be used instead of direct type assertions wherever a *DInt wrapped by a *DOidWrapper is possible.
3087: datum.go:218 - tree.MakeDBool
   └─ MakeDBool converts its argument to a *DBool, returning either DBoolTrue or DBoolFalse.
3088: expr.go:399 - (github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.ComparisonOperator).hasSubOperator
   └─ hasSubOperator returns if the ComparisonOperator is used with a sub-operator.
3089: eval.go:4544 - tree.foldComparisonExpr
   └─ foldComparisonExpr folds a given comparison operation and its expressions into an equivalent operation that will hit in the CmpOps map, returning this new operation, along with potentially flipped operands and "flipped" and "not" flags.
3090: datum.go:2912 - tree.AsDTuple [RECURSIVE]
   └─ AsDTuple attempts to retrieve a *DTuple from an Expr, returning a *DTuple and a flag signifying whether the assertion was successful. The function should be used instead of direct type assertions wherever a *DTuple wrapped by a *DOidWrapper is possible.
3091: eval.go:2440 - tree.evalDatumsCmp
   └─ evalDatumsCmp evaluates Datums (slice of Datum) using the provided sub-operator type (ANY/SOME, ALL) and its CmpOp with the left Datum. It returns the result of the ANY/SOME/ALL predicate. A NULL result is returned if there exists a NULL element and: ANY/SOME: no comparisons evaluate to true ALL: no comparisons evaluate to false For example, given 1 < ANY (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,3)) (right is a DTuple), evalTupleCmp would be called with: evalDatumsCmp(ctx, LT, Any, CmpOp(LT, leftType, rightParamType), leftDatum, rightTuple.D). Similarly, given 1 < ANY (ARRAY[1, 2, 3]) (right is a DArray), evalArrayCmp would be called with: evalDatumsCmp(ctx, LT, Any, CmpOp(LT, leftType, rightParamType), leftDatum, rightArray.Array).
3092: eval.go:4120 - tree.ensureExpectedType
   └─ ensureExpectedType will return an error if a datum does not match the provided type. If the expected type is Any or if the datum is a Null type, then no error will be returned.
3093: errutil_api.go:163 - errors.NewAssertionErrorWithWrappedErrf
   └─ NewAssertionErrorWithWrappedErrf wraps an error and turns it into an assertion error. Both details from the original error and the context of the caller are preserved. The original error is not visible as cause any more. The original error message is preserved. See the doc of `AssertionFailedf()` for more details.
3094: assertions.go:73 - errutil.NewAssertionErrorWithWrappedErrDepthf
   └─ NewAssertionErrorWithWrappedErrDepthf is like NewAssertionErrorWithWrappedErrf but the depth at which the call stack is captured can be specified. See the doc of `AssertionFailedf()` for more details.
3095: barriers.go:35 - barriers.Handled
   └─ Handled swallows the provided error and hides it from the Cause()/Unwrap() interface, and thus the Is() facility that identifies causes. However, it retains it for the purpose of printing the error out (e.g. for troubleshooting). The error message is preserved in full. Detail is shown: - via `errors.GetSafeDetails()`, shows details from hidden error. - when formatting with `%+v`. - in Sentry reports.
3096: barriers.go:45 - barriers.HandledWithMessage
   └─ HandledWithMessage is like Handled except the message is overridden. This can be used e.g. to hide message details or to prevent downstream code to make assertions on the message's contents.
3097: utilities.go:142 - errutil.WrapWithDepthf
   └─ WrapWithDepthf is like Wrapf except the depth to capture the stack trace is configurable. The the doc of `Wrapf()` for more details.
3098: message.go:37 - errutil.WithMessagef
   └─ WithMessagef annotates err with the format specifier. If err is nil, WithMessagef returns nil. The message is formatted as per redact.Sprintf, to separate safe and unsafe strings for Sentry reporting.
3099: secondary.go:31 - secondary.WithSecondaryError
   └─ WithSecondaryError enhances the error given as first argument with an annotation that carries the error given as second argument.  The second error does not participate in cause analysis (Is, etc) and is only revealed when printing out the error or collecting safe (PII-free) details for reporting. If additionalErr is nil, the first error is returned as-is. Tip: consider using CombineErrors() below in the general case. Detail is shown: - via `errors.GetSafeDetails()`, shows details from secondary error. - when formatting with `%+v`. - in Sentry reports.
3100: assert.go:34 - assert.WithAssertionFailure
   └─ WithAssertionFailure decorates the error with an assertion failure marker. This is not intended to be used directly (see AssertionFailed() for further decoration). Detail is shown: - when formatting with `%+v`. - in Sentry reports.
3101: function_name.go:41 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.ResolvableFunctionReference).String

   └─ Format implements the NodeFormatter interface.
3114: format.go:269 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.FmtCtx).Printf
   └─ Printf calls fmt.Fprintf on the linked bytes.Buffer. It is provided for convenience, to avoid having to call fmt.Fprintf(&ctx.Buffer, ...). Note: DO NOT USE THIS TO INTERPOLATE %s ON NodeFormatter OBJECTS. This would call the String() method on them and would fail to reuse the same bytes buffer (and waste allocations). Instead use ctx.FormatNode().
3115: show.go:499 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.ShowHistogram).Format

   └─ EncodeFlags returns the subset of the flags that are also lex encode flags.
3120: encode.go:90 - lex.EncodeSQLStringWithFlags
   └─ EncodeSQLStringWithFlags writes a string literal to buf. All unicode and non-printable characters are escaped. flags controls the output format: if encodeBareString is set, the output string will not be wrapped in quotes if the strings contains no special characters.
3121: encode.go:49 - (github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/lex.EncodeFlags).HasFlags
   └─ HasFlags tests whether the given flags are set.

   └─ Format implements the NodeFormatter interface.
3136: expr.go:123 - tree.exprFmtWithParen
   └─ exprFmtWithParen is a variant of Format() which adds a set of outer parens if the expression involves an operator. It is used internally when the expression is part of another expression and we know it is preceded or followed by an operator.
3137: types.go:1313 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).SQLString [RECURSIVE]
   └─ SQLString returns the CockroachDB native SQL string that can be used to reproduce the type via parsing the string as a type. It is used in error messages and also to produce the output of SHOW CREATE.
3138: strings.go:687 - strings.ToUpper
   └─ ToUpper returns s with all Unicode letters mapped to their upper case.
3139: strings.go:532 - strings.Map
   └─ Map returns a copy of the string s with all its characters modified according to the mapping function. If mapping returns a negative value, the character is dropped from the string with no replacement.
3140: letter.go:268 - unicode.ToUpper
   └─ ToUpper maps the rune to upper case.
3141: letter.go:262 - unicode.To
   └─ To maps the rune to the specified case: [UpperCase], [LowerCase], or [TitleCase].
3142: letter.go:251 - unicode.to

   └─ stringTypeSQL returns the visible type name plus any width specifier for the STRING/COLLATEDSTRING type.
3146: types.go:2030 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).collatedStringTypeSQL
   └─ collatedStringTypeSQL returns the string representation of a COLLATEDSTRING or []COLLATEDSTRING type. This is tricky in the case of an array of collated string, since brackets must precede the COLLATE identifier: STRING COLLATE EN VARCHAR(20)[] COLLATE DE
3147: encode.go:188 - lex.EncodeLocaleName
   └─ EncodeLocaleName writes the locale identifier in s to buf. Any dash characters are mapped to underscore characters. Underscore characters do not need to be quoted, and they are considered equivalent to dash characters by the CLDR standard: http://cldr.unicode.org/.
3148: types.go:965 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/types.T).Scale
   └─ Scale is an alias method for Width, used for clarity for types in DecimalFamily.

3153: mgc.go:743 - runtime.gcStart$2
3154: proc.go:1603 - runtime.stopTheWorldWithSema
   └─ stopTheWorldWithSema is the core implementation of stopTheWorld. The caller is responsible for acquiring worldsema and disabling preemption first and then should stopTheWorldWithSema on the system stack: semacquire(&worldsema, 0) m.preemptoff = "reason" var stw worldStop systemstack(func() { stw = stopTheWorldWithSema(reason) }) When finished, the caller must either call startTheWorld or undo these three operations separately: m.preemptoff = "" systemstack(func() { now = startTheWorldWithSema(stw) }) semrelease(&worldsema) It is allowed to acquire worldsema once and then execute multiple startTheWorldWithSema/stopTheWorldWithSema pairs. Other P's are able to execute between successive calls to startTheWorldWithSema and stopTheWorldWithSema. Holding worldsema causes any other goroutines invoking stopTheWorld to block. Returns the STW context. When starting the world, this context must be passed to startTheWorldWithSema. go:systemstack
3155: traceruntime.go:342 - (runtime.traceLocker).STWStart
   └─ STWStart traces a STWBegin event.
3156: traceevent.go:78 - (runtime.traceLocker).string
   └─ string returns a traceArg representing s which may be passed to write. The string is assumed to be relatively short and popular, so it may be stored for a while in the string dictionary.
3157: tracestring.go:25 - (*runtime.traceStringTable).put
   └─ put adds a string to the table, emits it, and returns a unique ID for it.
3158: string.go:295 - runtime.stringStructOf
3159: proc.go:6458 - runtime.preemptall
   └─ Tell all goroutines that they have been preempted and they should stop. This function is purely best-effort. It can fail to inform a goroutine if a processor just started running it. No locks need to be held. Returns true if preemption request was issued to at least one goroutine.
3160: traceruntime.go:538 - (runtime.traceLocker).ProcSteal
   └─ ProcSteal indicates that our current M stole a P from another M. inSyscall indicates that we're stealing the P from a syscall context. The caller must have ownership of pp.
3161: proc.go:1449 - (runtime.stwReason).isGC
3162: lock_futex.go:106 - runtime.notetsleep
3163: lock_futex.go:60 - runtime.notetsleep_internal
   └─ May run with m.p==nil if called from notetsleep, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nosplit go:nowritebarrier
3164: lockrank_off.go:60 - runtime.worldStopped
   └─ go:nosplit
3165: makefunc.go:141 - reflect.methodValueCall
   └─ methodValueCall is an assembly function that is the code half of the function returned from makeMethodValue. It expects a *methodValue as its context register, and its job is to invoke callMethod(ctxt, frame) where ctxt is the context register and frame is a pointer to the first word in the passed-in argument frame.

3168: mgc.go:820 - runtime.gcStart$4
3169: proc.go:1749 - runtime.startTheWorldWithSema
   └─ reason is the same STW reason passed to stopTheWorld. start is the start time returned by stopTheWorld. now is the current time; prefer to pass 0 to capture a fresh timestamp. stattTheWorldWithSema returns now.
3170: proc.go:5852 - runtime.procresize
   └─ Change number of processors. sched.lock must be held, and the world must be stopped. gcworkbufs must not be being modified by either the GC or the write barrier code, so the GC must not be running if the number of Ps actually changes. Returns list of Ps with local work, they need to be scheduled by the caller.
3171: traceruntime.go:286 - (runtime.traceLocker).Gomaxprocs
   └─ Gomaxprocs emits a ProcsChange event.
3172: proc.go:5736 - (*runtime.p).init

   └─ GoStart emits a GoStart event. Must be called with a valid P.
3177: proc.go:5776 - (*runtime.p).destroy
   └─ destroy releases all of the resources associated with pp and transitions it to status _Pdead. sched.lock must be held and the world must be stopped.
3178: proc.go:6852 - runtime.globrunqputhead
   └─ Put gp at the head of the global runnable queue. sched.lock must be held. May run during STW, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrierrec
3179: proc.go:7316 - (*runtime.gQueue).push
   └─ push adds gp to the head of q.
3180: time.go:827 - (*runtime.timers).take
   └─ take moves any timers from src into ts and then clears the timer state from src, because src is being destroyed. The caller must not have locked either timers. For now this is only called when the world is stopped.
3181: time.go:247 - (*runtime.timers).trace
3182: types.go:27 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Int32).Store
   └─ Store updates the value atomically. go:nosplit
3183: stubs.go:27 - atomic.Storeint32
   └─ go:noescape
3184: time.go:450 - (*runtime.timers).addHeap
   └─ addHeap adds t to the timers heap. The caller must hold ts.lock or the world must be stopped. The caller must also have checked that t belongs in the heap. Callers that are not sure can call t.maybeAdd instead, but note that maybeAdd has different locking requirements.
3185: lockrank_off.go:72 - runtime.assertWorldStoppedOrLockHeld

   └─ siftUp puts the timer at position i in the right place in the heap by moving it up toward the top of the heap.
3192: time.go:1430 - runtime.badTimer
   └─ badTimer is called if the timer data structures have been corrupted, presumably due to racy use by the program. We panic here rather than panicking due to invalid slice access while holding locks. See issue #25686.
3193: time.go:168 - (runtime.timerWhen).less
   └─ less reports whether tw is less than other.
3194: time.go:1293 - (*runtime.timers).updateMinWhenHeap
   └─ updateMinWhenHeap sets ts.minWhenHeap to ts.heap[0].when. The caller must have locked ts or the world must be stopped.
3195: mcache.go:108 - runtime.freemcache
   └─ freemcache releases resources associated with this mcache and puts the object onto a free list. In some cases there is no way to simply release resources, such as statistics, so donate them to a different mcache (the recipient).
3196: proc.go:5410 - runtime.gfpurge
   └─ Purge all cached G's from gfree list to the global list.
3197: proc.go:7403 - (*runtime.gList).pop
   └─ pop removes and returns the head of l. If l is empty, it returns nil.
3198: proc.go:7394 - (*runtime.gList).pushAll

3214: reader_providers.go:46 - (*github.com/mattdurham/blockpack/internal/executor.fileReaderProvider).Close
   └─ Close closes the underlying file. This method should be called when the provider is no longer needed to prevent file descriptor leaks.
3215: file_posix.go:19 - (*os.File).Close
   └─ Close closes the [File], rendering it unusable for I/O. On files that support [File.SetDeadline], any pending I/O operations will be canceled and return immediately with an [ErrClosed] error. Close will return an error if it has already been called.
3216: file_unix.go:306 - (*os.file).close
3217: dir_unix.go:40 - (*os.dirInfo).close
3218: fd_unix.go:91 - (*internal/poll.FD).Close
   └─ Close closes the FD. The underlying file descriptor is closed by the destroy method when there are no remaining references.
3219: fd_mutex.go:71 - (*internal/poll.fdMutex).increfAndClose
   └─ increfAndClose sets the state of mu to closed. It returns false if the file was already closed.
3220: fd_poll_runtime.go:57 - (*internal/poll.pollDesc).evict
   └─ Evict evicts fd from the pending list, unblocking any I/O running on fd.
3221: fd_poll_runtime.go:29 - poll.runtime_pollUnblock
3222: fd_mutex.go:211 - (*internal/poll.FD).decref
   └─ decref removes a reference from fd. It also closes fd when the state of fd is set to closed and there is no remaining reference.
3223: fd_mutex.go:102 - (*internal/poll.fdMutex).decref
   └─ decref removes a reference from mu. It reports whether there is no remaining reference.
3224: mfinal.go:432 - runtime.SetFinalizer
   └─ SetFinalizer sets the finalizer associated with obj to the provided finalizer function. When the garbage collector finds an unreachable block with an associated finalizer, it clears the association and runs finalizer(obj) in a separate goroutine. This makes obj reachable again, but now without an associated finalizer. Assuming that SetFinalizer is not called again, the next time the garbage collector sees that obj is unreachable, it will free obj. SetFinalizer(obj, nil) clears any finalizer associated with obj. New Go code should consider using [AddCleanup] instead, which is much less error-prone than SetFinalizer. The argument obj must be a pointer to an object allocated by calling new, by taking the address of a composite literal, or by taking the address of a local variable. The argument finalizer must be a function that takes a single argument to which obj's type can be assigned, and can have arbitrary ignored return values. If either of these is not true, SetFinalizer may abort the program. Finalizers are run in dependency order: if A points at B, both have finalizers, and they are otherwise unreachable, only the finalizer for A runs; once A is freed, the finalizer for B can run. If a cyclic structure includes a block with a finalizer, that cycle is not guaranteed to be garbage collected and the finalizer is not guaranteed to run, because there is no ordering that respects the dependencies. The finalizer is scheduled to run at some arbitrary time after the program can no longer reach the object to which obj points. There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits, so typically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources associated with an object during a long-running program. For example, an [os.File] object could use a finalizer to close the associated operating system file descriptor when a program discards an os.File without calling Close, but it would be a mistake to depend on a finalizer to flush an in-memory I/O buffer such as a [bufio.Writer], because the buffer would not be flushed at program exit. It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run if the size of *obj is zero bytes, because it may share same address with other zero-size objects in memory. See https://go.dev/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees. It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run for objects allocated in initializers for package-level variables. Such objects may be linker-allocated, not heap-allocated. Note that because finalizers may execute arbitrarily far into the future after an object is no longer referenced, the runtime is allowed to perform a space-saving optimization that batches objects together in a single allocation slot. The finalizer for an unreferenced object in such an allocation may never run if it always exists in the same batch as a referenced object. Typically, this batching only happens for tiny (on the order of 16 bytes or less) and pointer-free objects. A finalizer may run as soon as an object becomes unreachable. In order to use finalizers correctly, the program must ensure that the object is reachable until it is no longer required. Objects stored in global variables, or that can be found by tracing pointers from a global variable, are reachable. A function argument or receiver may become unreachable at the last point where the function mentions it. To make an unreachable object reachable, pass the object to a call of the [KeepAlive] function to mark the last point in the function where the object must be reachable. For example, if p points to a struct, such as os.File, that contains a file descriptor d, and p has a finalizer that closes that file descriptor, and if the last use of p in a function is a call to syscall.Write(p.d, buf, size), then p may be unreachable as soon as the program enters [syscall.Write]. The finalizer may run at that moment, closing p.d, causing syscall.Write to fail because it is writing to a closed file descriptor (or, worse, to an entirely different file descriptor opened by a different goroutine). To avoid this problem, call KeepAlive(p) after the call to syscall.Write. A single goroutine runs all finalizers for a program, sequentially. If a finalizer must run for a long time, it should do so by starting a new goroutine. In the terminology of the Go memory model, a call SetFinalizer(x, f) “synchronizes before” the finalization call f(x). However, there is no guarantee that KeepAlive(x) or any other use of x “synchronizes before” f(x), so in general a finalizer should use a mutex or other synchronization mechanism if it needs to access mutable state in x. For example, consider a finalizer that inspects a mutable field in x that is modified from time to time in the main program before x becomes unreachable and the finalizer is invoked. The modifications in the main program and the inspection in the finalizer need to use appropriate synchronization, such as mutexes or atomic updates, to avoid read-write races.

3244: stubs.go:264 - runtime.reflectcall
   └─ reflectcall calls fn with arguments described by stackArgs, stackArgsSize, frameSize, and regArgs. Arguments passed on the stack and space for return values passed on the stack must be laid out at the space pointed to by stackArgs (with total length stackArgsSize) according to the ABI. stackRetOffset must be some value <= stackArgsSize that indicates the offset within stackArgs where the return value space begins. frameSize is the total size of the argument frame at stackArgs and must therefore be >= stackArgsSize. It must include additional space for spilling register arguments for stack growth and preemption. TODO(mknyszek): Once we don't need the additional spill space, remove frameSize, since frameSize will be redundant with stackArgsSize. Arguments passed in registers must be laid out in regArgs according to the ABI. regArgs will hold any return values passed in registers after the call. reflectcall copies stack arguments from stackArgs to the goroutine stack, and then copies back stackArgsSize-stackRetOffset bytes back to the return space in stackArgs once fn has completed. It also "unspills" argument registers from regArgs before calling fn, and spills them back into regArgs immediately following the call to fn. If there are results being returned on the stack, the caller should pass the argument frame type as stackArgsType so that reflectcall can execute appropriate write barriers during the copy. reflectcall expects regArgs.ReturnIsPtr to be populated indicating which registers on the return path will contain Go pointers. It will then store these pointers in regArgs.Ptrs such that they are visible to the GC. Package reflect passes a frame type. In package runtime, there is only one call that copies results back, in callbackWrap in syscall_windows.go, and it does NOT pass a frame type, meaning there are no write barriers invoked. See that call site for justification. Package reflect accesses this symbol through a linkname. Arguments passed through to reflectcall do not escape. The type is used only in a very limited callee of reflectcall, the stackArgs are copied, and regArgs is only used in the reflectcall frame. go:noescape

3407: markers_print.go:29 - redact.Sprint
   └─ Sprint prints out the arguments and encloses unsafe bits between redaction markers. If either safe and unsafe bits of data contain the markers in their representation already, they are escaped first. If a RedactableString or RedactableBytes argument is passed, it is reproduced as-is without escaping.

3529: field_extract.go:595 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/util/timeutil/pgdate.fieldExtract).MakeDate
   └─ MakeDate returns a time.Time containing only the date components of the extract.
3530: time.go:1730 - time.Date
   └─ Date returns the Time corresponding to yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss + nsec nanoseconds in the appropriate zone for that time in the given location. The month, day, hour, min, sec, and nsec values may be outside their usual ranges and will be normalized during the conversion. For example, October 32 converts to November 1. A daylight savings time transition skips or repeats times. For example, in the United States, March 13, 2011 2:15am never occurred, while November 6, 2011 1:15am occurred twice. In such cases, the choice of time zone, and therefore the time, is not well-defined. Date returns a time that is correct in one of the two zones involved in the transition, but it does not guarantee which. Date panics if loc is nil.
3531: time.go:1698 - time.norm
   └─ norm returns nhi, nlo such that hi * base + lo == nhi * base + nlo 0 <= nlo < base
3532: time.go:595 - time.dateToAbsDays
   └─ dateToAbsDays takes a standard year/month/day and returns the number of days from the absolute epoch to that day. The days argument can be out of range and in particular can be negative.
3533: zoneinfo.go:149 - (*time.Location).lookup
   └─ lookup returns information about the time zone in use at an instant in time expressed as seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. The returned information gives the name of the zone (such as "CET"), the start and end times bracketing sec when that zone is in effect, the offset in seconds east of UTC (such as -5*60*60), and whether the daylight savings is being observed at that time.
3534: zoneinfo.go:233 - (*time.Location).lookupFirstZone
   └─ lookupFirstZone returns the index of the time zone to use for times before the first transition time, or when there are no transition times. The reference implementation in localtime.c from https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/releases/tzcode2013g.tar.gz implements the following algorithm for these cases: 1. If the first zone is unused by the transitions, use it. 2. Otherwise, if there are transition times, and the first transition is to a zone in daylight time, find the first non-daylight-time zone before and closest to the first transition zone. 3. Otherwise, use the first zone that is not daylight time, if there is one. 4. Otherwise, use the first zone.
3535: zoneinfo.go:261 - (*time.Location).firstZoneUsed
   └─ firstZoneUsed reports whether the first zone is used by some transition.
3536: pgdate.go:100 - pgdate.MakeDateFromTime
   └─ MakeDateFromTime creates a Date from the specified time. The timezone-relative date is used.
3537: time.go:1399 - (time.Time).Zone
   └─ Zone computes the time zone in effect at time t, returning the abbreviated name of the zone (such as "CET") and its offset in seconds east of UTC.
3538: pgdate.go:121 - pgdate.MakeDateFromUnixEpoch
   └─ MakeDateFromUnixEpoch creates a Date from the number of days since the Unix epoch.
3539: arith.go:47 - arith.SubWithOverflow
   └─ SubWithOverflow returns a-b. If ok is false, a-b overflowed.
3540: pgdate.go:132 - pgdate.MakeDateFromPGEpoch
   └─ MakeDateFromPGEpoch creates a Date from the number of days since 2000-01-01. MaxInt32 or MinInt32 represent the positive and negative infinity dates.
3541: datum.go:1738 - tree.NewDDate
   └─ NewDDate is a helper routine to create a *DDate initialized from its argument.
3542: datum.go:912 - tree.ParseDDecimal
   └─ ParseDDecimal parses and returns the *DDecimal Datum value represented by the provided string, or an error if parsing is unsuccessful.
3543: datum.go:920 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.DDecimal).SetString
   └─ SetString sets d to s. Any non-standard NaN values are converted to a normal NaN. Any negative zero is converted to positive.
3544: decimal.go:195 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Context).SetString
   └─ SetString sets d to s and returns d. The returned Decimal has its exponents restricted by the context and its value rounded if it contains more digits than the context's precision.

3548: stack.go:163 - errors.callers
3549: errors.go:201 - errors.Wrapf
   └─ Wrapf returns an error annotating err with a stack trace at the point Wrapf is called, and the format specifier. If err is nil, Wrapf returns nil.
3550: int.go:499 - (*math/big.Int).SetString
   └─ SetString sets z to the value of s, interpreted in the given base, and returns z and a boolean indicating success. The entire string (not just a prefix) must be valid for success. If SetString fails, the value of z is undefined but the returned value is nil. The base argument must be 0 or a value between 2 and [MaxBase]. For base 0, the number prefix determines the actual base: A prefix of “0b” or “0B” selects base 2, “0”, “0o” or “0O” selects base 8, and “0x” or “0X” selects base 16. Otherwise, the selected base is 10 and no prefix is accepted. For bases <= 36, lower and upper case letters are considered the same: The letters 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z' represent digit values 10 to 35. For bases > 36, the upper case letters 'A' to 'Z' represent the digit values 36 to 61. For base 0, an underscore character “_” may appear between a base prefix and an adjacent digit, and between successive digits; such underscores do not change the value of the number. Incorrect placement of underscores is reported as an error if there are no other errors. If base != 0, underscores are not recognized and act like any other character that is not a valid digit.
3551: reader.go:160 - strings.NewReader
   └─ NewReader returns a new [Reader] reading from s. It is similar to [bytes.NewBufferString] but more efficient and non-writable.
3552: int.go:505 - (*math/big.Int).setFromScanner
   └─ setFromScanner implements SetString given an io.ByteScanner. For documentation see comments of SetString.
3553: intconv.go:180 - (*math/big.Int).scan
   └─ scan sets z to the integer value corresponding to the longest possible prefix read from r representing a signed integer number in a given conversion base. It returns z, the actual conversion base used, and an error, if any. In the error case, the value of z is undefined but the returned value is nil. The syntax follows the syntax of integer literals in Go. The base argument must be 0 or a value from 2 through MaxBase. If the base is 0, the string prefix determines the actual conversion base. A prefix of “0b” or “0B” selects base 2; a “0”, “0o”, or “0O” prefix selects base 8, and a “0x” or “0X” prefix selects base 16. Otherwise the selected base is 10.
3554: intconv.go:197 - big.scanSign
3555: reader.go:66 - (*bytes.Reader).ReadByte
   └─ ReadByte implements the [io.ByteReader] interface.
3556: intconv.go:219 - (math/big.byteReader).ReadByte
3557: buffer.go:362 - (*bytes.Buffer).ReadByte
   └─ ReadByte reads and returns the next byte from the buffer. If no byte is available, it returns error [io.EOF].
3558: reader.go:66 - (*strings.Reader).ReadByte
   └─ ReadByte implements the [io.ByteReader] interface.
3559: reader.go:77 - (*bytes.Reader).UnreadByte
   └─ UnreadByte complements [Reader.ReadByte] in implementing the [io.ByteScanner] interface.
3560: intconv.go:227 - (math/big.byteReader).UnreadByte
3561: buffer.go:419 - (*bytes.Buffer).UnreadByte
   └─ UnreadByte unreads the last byte returned by the most recent successful read operation that read at least one byte. If a write has happened since the last read, if the last read returned an error, or if the read read zero bytes, UnreadByte returns an error.
3562: reader.go:77 - (*strings.Reader).UnreadByte
   └─ UnreadByte implements the [io.ByteScanner] interface.
3563: natconv.go:109 - (math/big.nat).scan
   └─ scan scans the number corresponding to the longest possible prefix from r representing an unsigned number in a given conversion base. scan returns the corresponding natural number res, the actual base b, a digit count, and a read or syntax error err, if any. For base 0, an underscore character “_” may appear between a base prefix and an adjacent digit, and between successive digits; such underscores do not change the value of the number, or the returned digit count. Incorrect placement of underscores is reported as an error if there are no other errors. If base != 0, underscores are not recognized and thus terminate scanning like any other character that is not a valid radix point or digit. number    = mantissa | prefix pmantissa . prefix    = "0" [ "b" | "B" | "o" | "O" | "x" | "X" ] . mantissa  = digits "." [ digits ] | digits | "." digits . pmantissa = [ "_" ] digits "." [ digits ] | [ "_" ] digits | "." digits . digits    = digit { [ "_" ] digit } . digit     = "0" ... "9" | "a" ... "z" | "A" ... "Z" . Unless fracOk is set, the base argument must be 0 or a value between 2 and MaxBase. If fracOk is set, the base argument must be one of 0, 2, 8, 10, or 16. Providing an invalid base argument leads to a run- time panic. For base 0, the number prefix determines the actual base: A prefix of “0b” or “0B” selects base 2, “0o” or “0O” selects base 8, and “0x” or “0X” selects base 16. If fracOk is false, a “0” prefix (immediately followed by digits) selects base 8 as well. Otherwise, the selected base is 10 and no prefix is accepted. If fracOk is set, a period followed by a fractional part is permitted. The result value is computed as if there were no period present; and the count value is used to determine the fractional part. For bases <= 36, lower and upper case letters are considered the same: The letters 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z' represent digit values 10 to 35. For bases > 36, the upper case letters 'A' to 'Z' represent the digit values 36 to 61. A result digit count > 0 corresponds to the number of (non-prefix) digits parsed. A digit count <= 0 indicates the presence of a period (if fracOk is set, only), and -count is the number of fractional digits found. In this case, the actual value of the scanned number is res * b**count.
3564: natconv.go:44 - big.pow
   └─ pow returns x**n for n > 0, and 1 otherwise.
3565: decimal.go:306 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).setExponent
   └─ setExponent sets d's Exponent to the sum of xs. Each value and the sum of xs must fit within an int32. An error occurs if the sum is outside of the MaxExponent or MinExponent range. res is any Condition previously set for this operation, which can cause Underflow to be set if, for example, Inexact is already set.

3569: table.go:121 - apd.setBigWithPow
3570: int.go:567 - (*math/big.Int).Exp
   └─ Exp sets z = x**y mod |m| (i.e. the sign of m is ignored), and returns z. If m == nil or m == 0, z = x**y unless y <= 0 then z = 1. If m != 0, y < 0, and x and m are not relatively prime, z is unchanged and nil is returned. Modular exponentiation of inputs of a particular size is not a cryptographically constant-time operation.

   └─ Inexact returns true if the Inexact flag is set.
3575: decimal.go:630 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).Modf
   └─ Modf sets integ to the integral part of d and frac to the fractional part such that d = integ+frac. If d is negative, both integ or frac will be either 0 or negative. integ.Exponent will be >= 0; frac.Exponent will be <= 0. Either argument can be nil, preventing it from being set.
3576: decimal.go:221 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).Set
   └─ Set sets d's fields to the values of x and returns d.
3577: int.go:273 - (*math/big.Int).Quo
   └─ Quo sets z to the quotient x/y for y != 0 and returns z. If y == 0, a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs. Quo implements truncated division (like Go); see [Int.QuoRem] for more details.

3584: condition.go:101 - (github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Condition).GoError
   └─ GoError converts r to an error based on the given traps and returns r. Traps are the conditions which will trigger an error result if the corresponding Flag condition occurred.
3585: errors.go:102 - errors.New
   └─ New returns an error with the supplied message. New also records the stack trace at the point it was called.

3591: datum.go:754 - tree.ParseDFloat
   └─ ParseDFloat parses and returns the *DFloat Datum value represented by the provided string, or an error if parsing is unsuccessful.
3592: atof.go:694 - strconv.ParseFloat
   └─ ParseFloat converts the string s to a floating-point number with the precision specified by bitSize: 32 for float32, or 64 for float64. When bitSize=32, the result still has type float64, but it will be convertible to float32 without changing its value. ParseFloat accepts decimal and hexadecimal floating-point numbers as defined by the Go syntax for [floating-point literals]. If s is well-formed and near a valid floating-point number, ParseFloat returns the nearest floating-point number rounded using IEEE754 unbiased rounding. (Parsing a hexadecimal floating-point value only rounds when there are more bits in the hexadecimal representation than will fit in the mantissa.) The errors that ParseFloat returns have concrete type *NumError and include err.Num = s. If s is not syntactically well-formed, ParseFloat returns err.Err = ErrSyntax. If s is syntactically well-formed but is more than 1/2 ULP away from the largest floating point number of the given size, ParseFloat returns f = ±Inf, err.Err = ErrRange. ParseFloat recognizes the string "NaN", and the (possibly signed) strings "Inf" and "Infinity" as their respective special floating point values. It ignores case when matching.

3596: atof.go:20 - strconv.commonPrefixLenIgnoreCase
   └─ commonPrefixLenIgnoreCase returns the length of the common prefix of s and prefix, with the character case of s ignored. The prefix argument must be all lower-case.
3597: atof.go:173 - strconv.readFloat
   └─ readFloat reads a decimal or hexadecimal mantissa and exponent from a float string representation in s; the number may be followed by other characters. readFloat reports the number of bytes consumed (i), and whether the number is valid (ok).
3598: atof.go:498 - strconv.atofHex
   └─ atofHex converts the hex floating-point string s to a rounded float32 or float64 value (depending on flt==&float32info or flt==&float64info) and returns it as a float64. The string s has already been parsed into a mantissa, exponent, and sign (neg==true for negative). If trunc is true, trailing non-zero bits have been omitted from the mantissa.
3599: unsafe.go:30 - math.Float32frombits
   └─ Float32frombits returns the floating-point number corresponding to the IEEE 754 binary representation b, with the sign bit of b and the result in the same bit position. Float32frombits(Float32bits(x)) == x.

3605: atof.go:616 - strconv.atof64
3606: atof.go:428 - strconv.atof64exact
   └─ If possible to convert decimal representation to 64-bit float f exactly, entirely in floating-point math, do so, avoiding the expense of decimalToFloatBits. Three common cases: value is exact integer value is exact integer * exact power of ten value is exact integer / exact power of ten These all produce potentially inexact but correctly rounded answers.
3607: eisel_lemire.go:25 - strconv.eiselLemire64
3608: datum.go:748 - tree.NewDFloat
   └─ NewDFloat is a helper routine to create a *DFloat initialized from its argument.

   └─ ParseINet parses postgres style INET types. See TestIPAddrParseINet for examples.
3611: ipaddr.go:160 - ipaddr.getFamily
   └─ getFamily checks what family the ip is in. If it doesn't appear to match either, getFamily returns -1.
3612: strings.go:1047 - strings.TrimRight
   └─ TrimRight returns a slice of the string s, with all trailing Unicode code points contained in cutset removed. To remove a suffix, use [TrimSuffix] instead.
3613: strings.go:1060 - strings.trimRightByte
3614: strings.go:964 - strings.makeASCIISet

   └─ IPv6Unspecified returns the IPv6 unspecified address "::".
3626: netip.go:492 - (net/netip.Addr).WithZone
   └─ WithZone returns an IP that's the same as ip but with the provided zone. If zone is empty, the zone is removed. If ip is an IPv4 address, WithZone is a no-op and returns ip unchanged.

   └─ Is6 reports whether ip is an IPv6 address, including IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
3628: netip.go:102 - netip.AddrFrom16
   └─ AddrFrom16 returns the IPv6 address given by the bytes in addr. An IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is left as an IPv6 address. (Use Unmap to convert them if needed.)
3629: netip.go:704 - (net/netip.Addr).As16
   └─ As16 returns the IP address in its 16-byte representation. IPv4 addresses are returned as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses with zones are returned without their zone (use the [Addr.Zone] method to get it). The ip zero value returns all zeroes.

3723: lib.go:479 - proto.UnmarshalJSONEnum
   └─ UnmarshalJSONEnum is a helper function to simplify recovering enum int values from their JSON-encoded representation. Given a map from the enum's symbolic names to its int values, and a byte buffer containing the JSON-encoded value, it returns an int32 that can be cast to the enum type by the caller. The function can deal with both JSON representations, numeric and symbolic.
3724: decode.go:102 - json.Unmarshal
   └─ Unmarshal parses the JSON-encoded data and stores the result in the value pointed to by v. If v is nil or not a pointer, Unmarshal returns an [InvalidUnmarshalError]. Unmarshal uses the inverse of the encodings that [Marshal] uses, allocating maps, slices, and pointers as necessary, with the following additional rules: To unmarshal JSON into a pointer, Unmarshal first handles the case of the JSON being the JSON literal null. In that case, Unmarshal sets the pointer to nil. Otherwise, Unmarshal unmarshals the JSON into the value pointed at by the pointer. If the pointer is nil, Unmarshal allocates a new value for it to point to. To unmarshal JSON into a value implementing [Unmarshaler], Unmarshal calls that value's [Unmarshaler.UnmarshalJSON] method, including when the input is a JSON null. Otherwise, if the value implements [encoding.TextUnmarshaler] and the input is a JSON quoted string, Unmarshal calls [encoding.TextUnmarshaler.UnmarshalText] with the unquoted form of the string. To unmarshal JSON into a struct, Unmarshal matches incoming object keys to the keys used by [Marshal] (either the struct field name or its tag), ignoring case. If multiple struct fields match an object key, an exact case match is preferred over a case-insensitive one. Incoming object members are processed in the order observed. If an object includes duplicate keys, later duplicates will replace or be merged into prior values. To unmarshal JSON into an interface value, Unmarshal stores one of these in the interface value: - bool, for JSON booleans - float64, for JSON numbers - string, for JSON strings - []any, for JSON arrays - map[string]any, for JSON objects - nil for JSON null To unmarshal a JSON array into a slice, Unmarshal resets the slice length to zero and then appends each element to the slice. As a special case, to unmarshal an empty JSON array into a slice, Unmarshal replaces the slice with a new empty slice. To unmarshal a JSON array into a Go array, Unmarshal decodes JSON array elements into corresponding Go array elements. If the Go array is smaller than the JSON array, the additional JSON array elements are discarded. If the JSON array is smaller than the Go array, the additional Go array elements are set to zero values. To unmarshal a JSON object into a map, Unmarshal first establishes a map to use. If the map is nil, Unmarshal allocates a new map. Otherwise Unmarshal reuses the existing map, keeping existing entries. Unmarshal then stores key-value pairs from the JSON object into the map. The map's key type must either be any string type, an integer, or implement [encoding.TextUnmarshaler]. If the JSON-encoded data contain a syntax error, Unmarshal returns a [SyntaxError]. If a JSON value is not appropriate for a given target type, or if a JSON number overflows the target type, Unmarshal skips that field and completes the unmarshaling as best it can. If no more serious errors are encountered, Unmarshal returns an [UnmarshalTypeError] describing the earliest such error. In any case, it's not guaranteed that all the remaining fields following the problematic one will be unmarshaled into the target object. The JSON null value unmarshals into an interface, map, pointer, or slice by setting that Go value to nil. Because null is often used in JSON to mean “not present,” unmarshaling a JSON null into any other Go type has no effect on the value and produces no error. When unmarshaling quoted strings, invalid UTF-8 or invalid UTF-16 surrogate pairs are not treated as an error. Instead, they are replaced by the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD.
3725: scanner.go:33 - json.checkValid
   └─ checkValid verifies that data is valid JSON-encoded data. scan is passed in for use by checkValid to avoid an allocation. checkValid returns nil or a SyntaxError.

3739: format_rfc3339.go:155 - time.parseStrictRFC3339
3740: format.go:1023 - time.Parse
   └─ Parse parses a formatted string and returns the time value it represents. See the documentation for the constant called [Layout] to see how to represent the format. The second argument must be parseable using the format string (layout) provided as the first argument. The example for [Time.Format] demonstrates the working of the layout string in detail and is a good reference. When parsing (only), the input may contain a fractional second field immediately after the seconds field, even if the layout does not signify its presence. In that case either a comma or a decimal point followed by a maximal series of digits is parsed as a fractional second. Fractional seconds are truncated to nanosecond precision. Elements omitted from the layout are assumed to be zero or, when zero is impossible, one, so parsing "3:04pm" returns the time corresponding to Jan 1, year 0, 15:04:00 UTC (note that because the year is 0, this time is before the zero Time). Years must be in the range 0000..9999. The day of the week is checked for syntax but it is otherwise ignored. For layouts specifying the two-digit year 06, a value NN >= 69 will be treated as 19NN and a value NN < 69 will be treated as 20NN. The remainder of this comment describes the handling of time zones. In the absence of a time zone indicator, Parse returns a time in UTC. When parsing a time with a zone offset like -0700, if the offset corresponds to a time zone used by the current location ([Local]), then Parse uses that location and zone in the returned time. Otherwise it records the time as being in a fabricated location with time fixed at the given zone offset. When parsing a time with a zone abbreviation like MST, if the zone abbreviation has a defined offset in the current location, then that offset is used. The zone abbreviation "UTC" is recognized as UTC regardless of location. If the zone abbreviation is unknown, Parse records the time as being in a fabricated location with the given zone abbreviation and a zero offset. This choice means that such a time can be parsed and reformatted with the same layout losslessly, but the exact instant used in the representation will differ by the actual zone offset. To avoid such problems, prefer time layouts that use a numeric zone offset, or use [ParseInLocation].
3741: format.go:1048 - time.parse
3742: format.go:203 - time.nextStdChunk
   └─ nextStdChunk finds the first occurrence of a std string in layout and returns the text before, the std string, and the text after. nextStdChunk should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/searKing/golang/go Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname nextStdChunk
3743: format.go:183 - time.startsWithLowerCase
   └─ startsWithLowerCase reports whether the string has a lower-case letter at the beginning. Its purpose is to prevent matching strings like "Month" when looking for "Mon".
3744: format.go:491 - time.stdFracSecond
   └─ The "std" value passed to appendNano contains two packed fields: the number of digits after the decimal and the separator character (period or comma). These functions pack and unpack that variable.

3753: format.go:499 - time.digitsLen
3754: format.go:1443 - time.parseTimeZone
   └─ parseTimeZone parses a time zone string and returns its length. Time zones are human-generated and unpredictable. We can't do precise error checking. On the other hand, for a correct parse there must be a time zone at the beginning of the string, so it's almost always true that there's one there. We look at the beginning of the string for a run of upper-case letters. If there are more than 5, it's an error. If there are 4 or 5 and the last is a T, it's a time zone. If there are 3, it's a time zone. Otherwise, other than special cases, it's not a time zone. GMT is special because it can have an hour offset.
3755: format.go:1493 - time.parseGMT
   └─ parseGMT parses a GMT time zone. The input string is known to start "GMT". The function checks whether that is followed by a sign and a number in the range -23 through +23 excluding zero.
3756: format.go:1505 - time.parseSignedOffset
   └─ parseSignedOffset parses a signed timezone offset (e.g. "+03" or "-04"). The function checks for a signed number in the range -23 through +23 excluding zero. Returns length of the found offset string or 0 otherwise.

3765: decode.go:1078 - (*encoding/json.decodeState).objectInterface
   └─ objectInterface is like object but returns map[string]any.
3766: decode.go:322 - (*encoding/json.decodeState).rescanLiteral
   └─ rescanLiteral is similar to scanWhile(scanContinue), but it specialises the common case where we're decoding a literal. The decoder scans the input twice, once for syntax errors and to check the length of the value, and the second to perform the decoding. Only in the second step do we use decodeState to tokenize literals, so we know there aren't any syntax errors. We can take advantage of that knowledge, and scan a literal's bytes much more quickly.
3767: decode.go:1187 - json.unquote
   └─ unquote converts a quoted JSON string literal s into an actual string t. The rules are different than for Go, so cannot use strconv.Unquote.
3768: decode.go:1202 - json.unquoteBytes
   └─ unquoteBytes should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/sonic Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname unquoteBytes
3769: decode.go:1164 - json.getu4
   └─ getu4 decodes \uXXXX from the beginning of s, returning the hex value, or it returns -1.
3770: utf16.go:30 - utf16.IsSurrogate
   └─ IsSurrogate reports whether the specified Unicode code point can appear in a surrogate pair.
3771: utf16.go:37 - utf16.DecodeRune
   └─ DecodeRune returns the UTF-16 decoding of a surrogate pair. If the pair is not a valid UTF-16 surrogate pair, DecodeRune returns the Unicode replacement code point U+FFFD.
3772: decode.go:1129 - (*encoding/json.decodeState).literalInterface
   └─ literalInterface consumes and returns a literal from d.data[d.off-1:] and it reads the following byte ahead. The first byte of the literal has been read already (that's how the caller knows it's a literal).
3773: decode.go:838 - (*encoding/json.decodeState).convertNumber
   └─ convertNumber converts the number literal s to a float64 or a Number depending on the setting of d.useNumber.
3774: value.go:1150 - (reflect.Value).Cap
   └─ Cap returns v's capacity. It panics if v's Kind is not [Array], [Chan], [Slice] or pointer to [Array].
3775: value.go:1158 - (reflect.Value).capNonSlice
3776: value.go:3626 - reflect.chancap
   └─ implemented in ../runtime go:noescape
3777: value.go:2661 - (reflect.Value).Grow
   └─ Grow increases the slice's capacity, if necessary, to guarantee space for another n elements. After Grow(n), at least n elements can be appended to the slice without another allocation. It panics if v's Kind is not a [Slice], or if n is negative or too large to allocate the memory, or if [Value.CanSet] returns false.
3778: value.go:2230 - (reflect.Value).SetLen
   └─ SetLen sets v's length to n. It panics if v's Kind is not [Slice], or if n is negative or greater than the capacity of the slice, or if [Value.CanSet] returns false.
3779: value.go:1763 - (reflect.Value).SetZero
   └─ SetZero sets v to be the zero value of v's type. It panics if [Value.CanSet] returns false.
3780: decode.go:604 - (*encoding/json.decodeState).object
   └─ object consumes an object from d.data[d.off-1:], decoding into v. The first byte ('{') of the object has been read already.
3781: encode.go:1356 - json.cachedTypeFields
   └─ cachedTypeFields is like typeFields but uses a cache to avoid repeated work.
3782: encode.go:1117 - json.typeFields
   └─ typeFields returns a list of fields that JSON should recognize for the given type. The algorithm is breadth-first search over the set of structs to include - the top struct and then any reachable anonymous structs. typeFields should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/sonic Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname typeFields
3783: tags.go:19 - json.parseTag
   └─ parseTag splits a struct field's json tag into its name and comma-separated options.
3784: encode.go:958 - json.isValidTag
3785: tags.go:27 - (encoding/json.tagOptions).Contains
   └─ Contains reports whether a comma-separated list of options contains a particular substr flag. substr must be surrounded by a string boundary or commas.
3786: indent.go:21 - json.appendHTMLEscape
3787: encode.go:1343 - json.dominantField
   └─ dominantField looks through the fields, all of which are known to have the same name, to find the single field that dominates the others using Go's embedding rules, modified by the presence of JSON tags. If there are multiple top-level fields, the boolean will be false: This condition is an error in Go and we skip all the fields.
3788: encode.go:975 - json.typeByIndex
3789: encode.go:388 - json.typeEncoder
3790: encode.go:399 - json.typeEncoder$1
3791: encode.go:421 - json.newTypeEncoder [RECURSIVE]
   └─ newTypeEncoder constructs an encoderFunc for a type. The returned encoder only checks CanAddr when allowAddr is true.
3792: encode.go:953 - json.newCondAddrEncoder
   └─ newCondAddrEncoder returns an encoder that checks whether its value CanAddr and delegates to canAddrEnc if so, else to elseEnc.

3798: oncefunc.go:57 - OnceValue[encoding/json.encoderFunc]$1
3799: fold.go:16 - json.foldName
   └─ foldName returns a folded string such that foldName(x) == foldName(y) is identical to bytes.EqualFold(x, y).
3800: fold.go:22 - json.appendFoldedName
3801: fold.go:42 - json.foldRune
   └─ foldRune is returns the smallest rune for all runes in the same fold set.
3802: decode.go:408 - (*encoding/json.decodeState).valueQuoted
   └─ valueQuoted is like value but decodes a quoted string literal or literal null into an interface value. If it finds anything other than a quoted string literal or null, valueQuoted returns unquotedValue{}.
3803: decode.go:856 - (*encoding/json.decodeState).literalStore
   └─ literalStore decodes a literal stored in item into v. fromQuoted indicates whether this literal came from unwrapping a string from the ",string" struct tag option. this is used only to produce more helpful error messages.
3804: time.go:1640 - (*time.Time).UnmarshalText
   └─ UnmarshalText implements the [encoding.TextUnmarshaler] interface. The time must be in the RFC 3339 format.
3805: regexp.go:1300 - (*regexp.Regexp).UnmarshalText
   └─ UnmarshalText implements [encoding.TextUnmarshaler] by calling [Compile] on the encoded value.
3806: decimal.go:789 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).UnmarshalText
   └─ UnmarshalText implements the encoding.TextUnmarshaler interface.
3807: decimal.go:180 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Decimal).SetString
   └─ SetString sets d to s and returns d. It has no restrictions on exponents or precision.
3808: floatmarsh.go:130 - (*math/big.Float).UnmarshalText
   └─ UnmarshalText implements the [encoding.TextUnmarshaler] interface. The result is rounded per the precision and rounding mode of z. If z's precision is 0, it is changed to 64 before rounding takes effect.
3809: floatconv.go:259 - (*math/big.Float).Parse
   └─ Parse parses s which must contain a text representation of a floating- point number with a mantissa in the given conversion base (the exponent is always a decimal number), or a string representing an infinite value. For base 0, an underscore character “_” may appear between a base prefix and an adjacent digit, and between successive digits; such underscores do not change the value of the number, or the returned digit count. Incorrect placement of underscores is reported as an error if there are no other errors. If base != 0, underscores are not recognized and thus terminate scanning like any other character that is not a valid radix point or digit. It sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of the corresponding floating- point value, and returns z, the actual base b, and an error err, if any. The entire string (not just a prefix) must be consumed for success. If z's precision is 0, it is changed to 64 before rounding takes effect. The number must be of the form: number    = [ sign ] ( float | "inf" | "Inf" ) . sign      = "+" | "-" . float     = ( mantissa | prefix pmantissa ) [ exponent ] . prefix    = "0" [ "b" | "B" | "o" | "O" | "x" | "X" ] . mantissa  = digits "." [ digits ] | digits | "." digits . pmantissa = [ "_" ] digits "." [ digits ] | [ "_" ] digits | "." digits . exponent  = ( "e" | "E" | "p" | "P" ) [ sign ] digits . digits    = digit { [ "_" ] digit } . digit     = "0" ... "9" | "a" ... "z" | "A" ... "Z" . The base argument must be 0, 2, 8, 10, or 16. Providing an invalid base argument will lead to a run-time panic. For base 0, the number prefix determines the actual base: A prefix of “0b” or “0B” selects base 2, “0o” or “0O” selects base 8, and “0x” or “0X” selects base 16. Otherwise, the actual base is 10 and no prefix is accepted. The octal prefix "0" is not supported (a leading "0" is simply considered a "0"). A "p" or "P" exponent indicates a base 2 (rather than base 10) exponent; for instance, "0x1.fffffffffffffp1023" (using base 0) represents the maximum float64 value. For hexadecimal mantissae, the exponent character must be one of 'p' or 'P', if present (an "e" or "E" exponent indicator cannot be distinguished from a mantissa digit). The returned *Float f is nil and the value of z is valid but not defined if an error is reported.
3810: float.go:640 - (*math/big.Float).SetInf
   └─ SetInf sets z to the infinite Float -Inf if signbit is set, or +Inf if signbit is not set, and returns z. The precision of z is unchanged and the result is always [Exact].
3811: floatconv.go:33 - (*math/big.Float).scan
   └─ scan is like Parse but reads the longest possible prefix representing a valid floating point number from an io.ByteScanner rather than a string. It serves as the implementation of Parse. It does not recognize ±Inf and does not expect EOF at the end.
3812: ratconv.go:226 - big.scanExponent
   └─ scanExponent scans the longest possible prefix of r representing a base 10 (“e”, “E”) or a base 2 (“p”, “P”) exponent, if any. It returns the exponent, the exponent base (10 or 2), or a read or syntax error, if any. If sepOk is set, an underscore character “_” may appear between successive exponent digits; such underscores do not change the value of the exponent. Incorrect placement of underscores is reported as an error if there are no other errors. If sepOk is not set, underscores are not recognized and thus terminate scanning like any other character that is not a valid digit. exponent = ( "e" | "E" | "p" | "P" ) [ sign ] digits . sign     = "+" | "-" . digits   = digit { [ '_' ] digit } . digit    = "0" ... "9" . A base 2 exponent is only permitted if base2ok is set.
3813: float.go:208 - (*math/big.Float).Prec
   └─ Prec returns the mantissa precision of x in bits. The result may be 0 for |x| == 0 and |x| == Inf.
3814: floatconv.go:189 - (*math/big.Float).pow5
   └─ pow5 sets z to 5**n and returns z. n must not be negative.
3815: float.go:531 - (*math/big.Float).SetUint64
   └─ SetUint64 sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z. If z's precision is 0, it is changed to 64 (and rounding will have no effect).
3816: float.go:507 - (*math/big.Float).setBits64
3817: float.go:1590 - (*math/big.Float).Mul
   └─ Mul sets z to the rounded product x*y and returns z. Precision, rounding, and accuracy reporting are as for [Float.Add]. Mul panics with [ErrNaN] if one operand is zero and the other operand an infinity. The value of z is undefined in that case.
3818: float.go:1317 - (*math/big.Float).umul
   └─ z = x * y, ignoring signs of x and y for the multiplication but using the sign of z for rounding the result. x and y must have a non-empty mantissa and valid exponent.
3819: ratmarsh.go:85 - (*math/big.Rat).UnmarshalText
   └─ UnmarshalText implements the [encoding.TextUnmarshaler] interface.
3820: ratconv.go:58 - (*math/big.Rat).SetString
   └─ SetString sets z to the value of s and returns z and a boolean indicating success. s can be given as a (possibly signed) fraction "a/b", or as a floating-point number optionally followed by an exponent. If a fraction is provided, both the dividend and the divisor may be a decimal integer or independently use a prefix of “0b”, “0” or “0o”, or “0x” (or their upper-case variants) to denote a binary, octal, or hexadecimal integer, respectively. The divisor may not be signed. If a floating-point number is provided, it may be in decimal form or use any of the same prefixes as above but for “0” to denote a non-decimal mantissa. A leading “0” is considered a decimal leading 0; it does not indicate octal representation in this case. An optional base-10 “e” or base-2 “p” (or their upper-case variants) exponent may be provided as well, except for hexadecimal floats which only accept an (optional) “p” exponent (because an “e” or “E” cannot be distinguished from a mantissa digit). If the exponent's absolute value is too large, the operation may fail. The entire string, not just a prefix, must be valid for success. If the operation failed, the value of z is undefined but the returned value is nil.
3821: rat.go:433 - (*math/big.Rat).norm
3822: value.go:2145 - (reflect.Value).SetBool
   └─ SetBool sets v's underlying value. It panics if v's Kind is not [Bool] or if [Value.CanSet] returns false.
3823: value.go:2288 - (reflect.Value).SetString
   └─ SetString sets v's underlying value to x. It panics if v's Kind is not [String] or if [Value.CanSet] returns false.
3824: encode.go:647 - json.isValidNumber
   └─ isValidNumber reports whether s is a valid JSON number literal. isValidNumber should be an internal detail, but widely used packages access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include: - github.com/bytedance/sonic Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401. go:linkname isValidNumber
3825: value.go:2208 - (reflect.Value).SetInt
   └─ SetInt sets v's underlying value to x. It panics if v's Kind is not [Int], [Int8], [Int16], [Int32], or [Int64], or if [Value.CanSet] returns false.
3826: value.go:1969 - (reflect.Value).OverflowInt
   └─ OverflowInt reports whether the int64 x cannot be represented by v's type. It panics if v's Kind is not [Int], [Int8], [Int16], [Int32], or [Int64].
3827: type.go:588 - (*reflect.rtype).Bits
3828: value.go:2257 - (reflect.Value).SetUint
   └─ SetUint sets v's underlying value to x. It panics if v's Kind is not [Uint], [Uintptr], [Uint8], [Uint16], [Uint32], or [Uint64], or if [Value.CanSet] returns false.
3829: value.go:1982 - (reflect.Value).OverflowUint
   └─ OverflowUint reports whether the uint64 x cannot be represented by v's type. It panics if v's Kind is not [Uint], [Uintptr], [Uint8], [Uint16], [Uint32], or [Uint64].
3830: value.go:2193 - (reflect.Value).SetFloat
   └─ SetFloat sets v's underlying value to x. It panics if v's Kind is not [Float32] or [Float64], or if [Value.CanSet] returns false.
3831: value.go:1949 - (reflect.Value).OverflowFloat
   └─ OverflowFloat reports whether the float64 x cannot be represented by v's type. It panics if v's Kind is not [Float32] or [Float64].
3832: value.go:1960 - reflect.overflowFloat32
3833: language.go:166 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.Tag).UnmarshalText
   └─ UnmarshalText implements encoding.TextUnmarshaler.
3834: parse.go:230 - language.Parse
   └─ Parse parses the given BCP 47 string and returns a valid Tag. If parsing failed it returns an error and any part of the tag that could be parsed. If parsing succeeded but an unknown value was found, it returns ValueError. The Tag returned in this case is just stripped of the unknown value. All other values are preserved. It accepts tags in the BCP 47 format and extensions to this standard defined in https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers.
3835: parse.go:85 - language.makeScannerString
3836: parse.go:104 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.scanner).init
3837: parse.go:183 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.scanner).scan
   └─ scan parses the next token of a BCP 47 string.  Tokens that are larger than 8 characters or include non-alphanumeric characters result in an error and are gobbled and removed from the output. It returns the end position of the last token consumed.
3838: parse.go:158 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.scanner).gobble
   └─ gobble removes the current token from the input. Caller must call scan after calling gobble.
3839: parse.go:123 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.scanner).setError
3840: parse.go:23 - language.isAlphaNum
   └─ isAlphaNum returns true if the string contains only ASCII letters or digits.
3841: parse.go:261 - language.parse
3842: parse.go:114 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.scanner).toLower
   └─ restToLower converts the string between start and end to lower case.
3843: parse.go:455 - language.parseExtensions
   └─ parseExtensions parses and normalizes the extensions in the buffer. It returns the last position of scan.b that is part of any extension. It also trims scan.b to remove excess parts accordingly.
3844: parse.go:494 - language.parseExtension
   └─ parseExtension parses a single extension and returns the position of the extension end.
3845: bytes.go:565 - bytes.Join
   └─ Join concatenates the elements of s to create a new byte slice. The separator sep is placed between elements in the resulting slice.
3846: sort.go:233 - sort.Stable
   └─ Stable sorts data in ascending order as determined by the Less method, while keeping the original order of equal elements. It makes one call to data.Len to determine n, O(n*log(n)) calls to data.Less and O(n*log(n)*log(n)) calls to data.Swap. Note: in many situations, the newer slices.SortStableFunc function is more ergonomic and runs faster.
3847: zsortinterface.go:335 - sort.stable
3848: zsortinterface.go:378 - sort.symMerge [RECURSIVE]
   └─ symMerge merges the two sorted subsequences data[a:m] and data[m:b] using the SymMerge algorithm from Pok-Son Kim and Arne Kutzner, "Stable Minimum Storage Merging by Symmetric Comparisons", in Susanne Albers and Tomasz Radzik, editors, Algorithms - ESA 2004, volume 3221 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 714-723. Springer, 2004. Let M = m-a and N = b-n. Wolog M < N. The recursion depth is bound by ceil(log(N+M)). The algorithm needs O(M*log(N/M + 1)) calls to data.Less. The algorithm needs O((M+N)*log(M)) calls to data.Swap. The paper gives O((M+N)*log(M)) as the number of assignments assuming a rotation algorithm which uses O(M+N+gcd(M+N)) assignments. The argumentation in the paper carries through for Swap operations, especially as the block swapping rotate uses only O(M+N) Swaps. symMerge assumes non-degenerate arguments: a < m && m < b. Having the caller check this condition eliminates many leaf recursion calls, which improves performance.
3849: zsortinterface.go:464 - sort.rotate
   └─ rotate rotates two consecutive blocks u = data[a:m] and v = data[m:b] in data: Data of the form 'x u v y' is changed to 'x v u y'. rotate performs at most b-a many calls to data.Swap, and it assumes non-degenerate arguments: a < m && m < b.
3850: zsortinterface.go:329 - sort.swapRange
3851: parse.go:171 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.scanner).deleteRange
   └─ deleteRange removes the given range from s.b before the current token.
3852: parse.go:214 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.scanner).acceptMinSize
   └─ acceptMinSize parses multiple tokens of the given size or greater. It returns the end position of the last token consumed.
3853: parse.go:300 - language.parseTag
   └─ parseTag parses language, script, region and variants. It returns a Tag and the end position in the input that was parsed. If doNorm is true, then <lang>-<extlang> will be normalized to <extlang>.
3854: lookup.go:39 - language.getLangID
   └─ getLangID returns the langID of s if s is a canonical subtag or langUnknown if s is not a canonical subtag.
3855: lookup.go:66 - language.getLangISO2
   └─ getLangISO2 returns the langID for the given 2-letter ISO language code or unknownLang if this does not exist.
3856: tag.go:77 - tag.FixCase
   └─ FixCase reformats b to the same pattern of cases as form. If returns false if string b is malformed.
3857: tag.go:24 - (golang.org/x/text/internal/tag.Index).Index
   └─ Index reports the index of the given key or -1 if it could not be found. Only the first len(key) bytes from the start of the 4-byte entries will be considered for the search and the first match in Index will be returned.
3858: search.go:58 - sort.Search
   └─ Search uses binary search to find and return the smallest index i in [0, n) at which f(i) is true, assuming that on the range [0, n), f(i) == true implies f(i+1) == true. That is, Search requires that f is false for some (possibly empty) prefix of the input range [0, n) and then true for the (possibly empty) remainder; Search returns the first true index. If there is no such index, Search returns n. (Note that the "not found" return value is not -1 as in, for instance, strings.Index.) Search calls f(i) only for i in the range [0, n). A common use of Search is to find the index i for a value x in a sorted, indexable data structure such as an array or slice. In this case, the argument f, typically a closure, captures the value to be searched for, and how the data structure is indexed and ordered. For instance, given a slice data sorted in ascending order, the call Search(len(data), func(i int) bool { return data[i] >= 23 }) returns the smallest index i such that data[i] >= 23. If the caller wants to find whether 23 is in the slice, it must test data[i] == 23 separately. Searching data sorted in descending order would use the <= operator instead of the >= operator. To complete the example above, the following code tries to find the value x in an integer slice data sorted in ascending order: x := 23 i := sort.Search(len(data), func(i int) bool { return data[i] >= x }) if i < len(data) && data[i] == x { // x is present at data[i] } else { // x is not present in data, // but i is the index where it would be inserted. } As a more whimsical example, this program guesses your number: func GuessingGame() { var s string fmt.Printf("Pick an integer from 0 to 100.\n") answer := sort.Search(100, func(i int) bool { fmt.Printf("Is your number <= %d? ", i) fmt.Scanf("%s", &s) return s != "" && s[0] == 'y' }) fmt.Printf("Your number is %d.\n", answer) }

3863: datum.go:2230 - tree.compareTimestamps
3864: datum.go:2202 - tree.timeFromDatumForComparison
   └─ timeFromDatumForComparison gets the time from a datum object to use strictly for comparison usage.
3865: datum.go:2356 - tree.MakeDTimestampTZFromDate
   └─ MakeDTimestampTZFromDate creates a DTimestampTZ from a DDate. This will be equivalent to the midnight of the given zone.
3866: pgdate.go:146 - (github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/util/timeutil/pgdate.Date).ToTime
   └─ ToTime returns d as a time.Time. Non finite dates return an error.
3867: pgdate.go:197 - (github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/util/timeutil/pgdate.Date).UnixEpochDays
   └─ UnixEpochDays returns the number of days since the Unix epoch. Infinite dates are converted to MinInt64 or MaxInt64.
3868: time.go:52 - timeutil.Unix
   └─ Unix wraps time.Unix ensuring that the result is in UTC instead of Local.
3869: datum.go:2350 - tree.MakeDTimestampTZ
   └─ MakeDTimestampTZ creates a DTimestampTZ with specified precision.
3870: time.go:1795 - (time.Time).Round
   └─ Round returns the result of rounding t to the nearest multiple of d (since the zero time). The rounding behavior for halfway values is to round up. If d <= 0, Round returns t stripped of any monotonic clock reading but otherwise unchanged. Round operates on the time as an absolute duration since the zero time; it does not operate on the presentation form of the time. Thus, Round(Hour) may return a time with a non-zero minute, depending on the time's Location.
3871: time.go:1810 - time.div
   └─ div divides t by d and returns the quotient parity and remainder. We don't use the quotient parity anymore (round half up instead of round to even) but it's still here in case we change our minds.

3927: encode.go:291 - json.decodeJSONNumber
3928: encoding.go:2192 - encoding.DecodeUntaggedDecimalValue
   └─ DecodeUntaggedDecimalValue decodes a value encoded by EncodeUntaggedDecimalValue.
3929: encoding.go:1771 - encoding.DecodeNonsortingStdlibUvarint
   └─ DecodeNonsortingStdlibUvarint decodes a value encoded with binary.PutUvarint. It returns the length of the encoded varint and value.
3930: varint.go:68 - binary.Uvarint
   └─ Uvarint decodes a uint64 from buf and returns that value and the number of bytes read (> 0). If an error occurred, the value is 0 and the number of bytes n is <= 0 meaning: - n == 0: buf too small; - n < 0: value larger than 64 bits (overflow) and -n is the number of bytes read.
3931: errutil_api.go:36 - errors.New
   └─ New creates an error with a simple error message. A stack trace is retained. Note: the message string is assumed to not contain PII and is included in Sentry reports. Use errors.Newf("%s", <unsafestring>) for errors strings that may contain PII information. Detail output: - message via `Error()` and formatting using `%v`/`%s`/`%q`. - everything when formatting with `%+v`. - stack trace and message via `errors.GetSafeDetails()`. - stack trace and message in Sentry reports.
3932: decimal.go:618 - encoding.DecodeNonsortingDecimal
   └─ DecodeNonsortingDecimal returns the decoded decimal from buf encoded with EncodeNonsortingDecimal. buf is assumed to contain only the encoded decimal, as the function does not know from the encoding itself what the length of the encoded value is.
3933: decimal.go:626 - encoding.DecodeIntoNonsortingDecimal
   └─ DecodeIntoNonsortingDecimal is like DecodeNonsortingDecimal, but it operates on the passed-in *apd.Decimal instead of producing a new one.
3934: decimal.go:679 - encoding.decodeNonsortingDecimalValue
3935: encoding.go:427 - encoding.DecodeUvarintAscending
   └─ DecodeUvarintAscending decodes a varint encoded uint64 from the input buffer. The remainder of the input buffer and the decoded uint64 are returned.
3936: int.go:518 - (*math/big.Int).SetBytes

3942: encoding.go:165 - encoding.DecodeUint32Ascending
   └─ DecodeUint32Ascending decodes a uint32 from the input buffer, treating the input as a big-endian 4 byte uint32 representation. The remainder of the input buffer and the decoded uint32 are returned.
3943: jentry.go:101 - json.decodeJEntry
   └─ decodeJEntry decodes a 4-byte JEntry from a buffer. The current offset is required because a JEntry can either encode a length or an offset, and while a length can be interpreted locally, the current decoding offset is required in order to interpret the encoded offset.

   └─ findTypeForKey returns the start and end position for the type corresponding to key or the point at which to insert the key-value pair if the type wasn't found. The hasExt return value reports whether an -u extension was present. Note: the extensions are typically very small and are likely to contain only one key-type pair.
3988: parse.go:596 - language.nextExtension
   └─ nextExtension finds the next extension within the string, searching for the -<char>- pattern from position p. In the fast majority of cases, language tags will have at most one extension and extensions tend to be small.

4016: buffer.go:478 - bytes.NewBuffer
   └─ NewBuffer creates and initializes a new [Buffer] using buf as its initial contents. The new [Buffer] takes ownership of buf, and the caller should not use buf after this call. NewBuffer is intended to prepare a [Buffer] to read existing data. It can also be used to set the initial size of the internal buffer for writing. To do that, buf should have the desired capacity but a length of zero. In most cases, new([Buffer]) (or just declaring a [Buffer] variable) is sufficient to initialize a [Buffer].
4017: parse.go:351 - language.parseVariants
   └─ parseVariants scans tokens as long as each token is a valid variant string. Duplicate variants are removed.
4018: lookup.go:403 - language.grandfathered

TypeForKey will traverse the inheritance chain to get the correct value. If there are multiple types associated with a key, only the first will be returned. If there is no type associated with a key, it returns the empty string.
4024: language.go:513 - language.ParseRegion
   └─ ParseRegion parses a 2- or 3-letter ISO 3166-1 or a UN M.49 code. It returns a ValueError if s is a well-formed but unknown region identifier or another error if another error occurred.

   └─ Fields splits the string s around each instance of one or more consecutive white space characters, as defined by [unicode.IsSpace], returning a slice of substrings of s or an empty slice if s contains only white space. Every element of the returned slice is non-empty. Unlike [Split], leading and trailing runs runs of white space characters are discarded.
4088: strings.go:441 - strings.FieldsFunc
   └─ FieldsFunc splits the string s at each run of Unicode code points c satisfying f(c) and returns an array of slices of s. If all code points in s satisfy f(c) or the string is empty, an empty slice is returned. Every element of the returned slice is non-empty. Unlike [SplitFunc], leading and trailing runs of code points satisfying f(c) are discarded. FieldsFunc makes no guarantees about the order in which it calls f(c) and assumes that f always returns the same value for a given c.

   └─ Consumes any number of spaces.
4096: interval.go:41 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.intervalLexer).consumeNum
   └─ consumeNum consumes the next decimal number. 1st return value is the integer part. 2nd return value is whether a decimal part was encountered. 3rd return value is the decimal part as a float. If the number is negative, both the 1st and 3rd return value are negative. The decimal value is returned separately from the integer value so as to support large integer values which would not fit in a float.

   └─ Float64Val returns the nearest Go float64 value of x and whether the result is exact; x must be numeric or an [Unknown], but not [Complex]. For values too small (too close to 0) to represent as float64, [Float64Val] silently underflows to 0. The result sign always matches the sign of x, even for 0. If x is [Unknown], the result is (0, false).
4143: float.go:959 - (*math/big.Float).Float64
   └─ Float64 returns the float64 value nearest to x. If x is too small to be represented by a float64 (|x| < [math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64]), the result is (0, [Below]) or (-0, [Above]), respectively, depending on the sign of x. If x is too large to be represented by a float64 (|x| > [math.MaxFloat64]), the result is (+Inf, [Above]) or (-Inf, [Below]), depending on the sign of x.
4144: float.go:713 - big.msb64

   └─ Append appends the string representation of x, as generated by x.Text(base), to buf and returns the extended buffer.
4161: value.go:248 - (*go/constant.stringVal).ExactString
4162: value.go:138 - (*go/constant.stringVal).string
   └─ string constructs and returns the actual string literal value. If x represents an addition, then it rewrites x to be a single string, to speed future calls. This lazy construction avoids building different string values for all subpieces of a large concatenation. See golang.org/issue/23348.
4163: value.go:166 - (*go/constant.stringVal).appendReverse [RECURSIVE]
   └─ appendReverse appends to list all of x's subpieces, but in reverse, and returns the result. Appending the reversal allows processing the right side in a recursive call and the left side in a loop. Because a chain like a + b + c + d + e is actually represented as ((((a + b) + c) + d) + e), the left-side loop avoids deep recursion. x must be locked.
4164: value.go:152 - constant.reverse
   └─ reverse reverses x in place and returns it.
4165: value.go:260 - (go/constant.floatVal).ExactString
4166: context.go:266 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/apd.Context).Quo
   └─ Quo sets d to the quotient x/y for y != 0. c.Precision must be > 0. If an exact division is required, use a context with high precision and verify it was exact by checking the Inexact flag on the return Condition.

4181: name_resolution.go:450 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.UnresolvedName).ResolveFunction
   └─ ResolveFunction transforms an UnresolvedName to a FunctionDefinition. Function resolution currently takes a "short path" using the assumption that there are no stored functions in the database. That is, only functions in the (virtual) global namespace and virtual schemas can be used. This in turn implies that the current database does not matter and no resolver is needed. TODO(whoever): this needs to be revisited when there can be stored functions. When that is the case, function names must be first normalized to e.g. TableName (or whatever an object name will be called by then) and then undergo regular name resolution via ResolveExisting(). When that happens, the following function can be removed.
4182: search_path.go:108 - (github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sessiondata.SearchPath).Iter
   └─ Iter returns an iterator through the search path. We must include the implicit pg_catalog and temporary schema at the beginning of the search path, unless they have been explicitly set later by the user. "The system catalog schema, pg_catalog, is always searched, whether it is mentioned in the path or not. If it is mentioned in the path then it will be searched in the specified order. If pg_catalog is not in the path then it will be searched before searching any of the path items." "Likewise, the current session's temporary-table schema, pg_temp_nnn, is always searched if it exists. It can be explicitly listed in the path by using the alias pg_temp. If it is not listed in the path then it is searched first (even before pg_catalog)." - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-client.html
4183: search_path.go:186 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sessiondata.SearchPathIter).Next [RECURSIVE]

4192: type_check.go:831 - tree.TypeCheck$1
4193: overload.go:436 - tree.typeCheckOverloadedExprs
   └─ typeCheckOverloadedExprs determines the correct overload to use for the given set of expression parameters, along with an optional desired return type. It returns the expression parameters after being type checked, along with a slice of candidate overloadImpls. The slice may have length: 0: overload resolution failed because no compatible overloads were found 1: overload resolution succeeded 2+: overload resolution failed because of ambiguity The inBinOp parameter denotes whether this type check is occurring within a binary operator, in which case we may need to make a guess that the two parameters are of the same type if one of them is NULL.

Returns ok=true if we should stop overload resolution, and returning either 1. the chosen overload in a slice, or 2. nil, along with the typed arguments. This modifies values within s as scratch slices, but only in the case where it returns true, which signals to the calling function that it should immediately return, so any mutations to s are irrelevant.
4311: overload.go:744 - tree.filterAttempt
   └─ filterAttempt attempts to filter the overloads down to a single candidate. If it succeeds, it will return true, along with the overload (in a slice for convenience) and a possible error. If it fails, it will return false and undo any filtering performed during the attempt.
4312: context.go:242 - context.WithCancel$1
4313: context.go:547 - (*context.cancelCtx).cancel [RECURSIVE]
   └─ cancel closes c.done, cancels each of c's children, and, if removeFromParent is true, removes c from its parent's children. cancel sets c.cause to cause if this is the first time c is canceled.
4314: value.go:28 - (*sync/atomic.Value).Load
   └─ Load returns the value set by the most recent Store. It returns nil if there has been no call to Store for this Value.
4315: value.go:47 - (*sync/atomic.Value).Store
   └─ Store sets the value of the [Value] v to val. All calls to Store for a given Value must use values of the same concrete type. Store of an inconsistent type panics, as does Store(nil).
4316: value.go:193 - atomic.runtime_procPin
   └─ Disable/enable preemption, implemented in runtime.
4317: doc.go:109 - atomic.CompareAndSwapPointer
   └─ CompareAndSwapPointer executes the compare-and-swap operation for a unsafe.Pointer value. Consider using the more ergonomic and less error-prone [Pointer.CompareAndSwap] instead.
4318: value.go:194 - atomic.runtime_procUnpin
4319: context.go:399 - context.removeChild
   └─ removeChild removes a context from its parent.
4320: context.go:382 - context.parentCancelCtx
   └─ parentCancelCtx returns the underlying *cancelCtx for parent. It does this by looking up parent.Value(&cancelCtxKey) to find the innermost enclosing *cancelCtx and then checking whether parent.Done() matches that *cancelCtx. (If not, the *cancelCtx has been wrapped in a custom implementation providing a different done channel, in which case we should not bypass it.)

4344: fse_decoder.go:52 - (*github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd.fseDecoder).readNCount
   └─ readNCount will read the symbol distribution so decoding tables can be constructed.
4345: bytereader.go:64 - (github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd.byteReader).Uint32NC
   └─ Uint32NC returns a little endian uint32 starting at current offset. The caller must be sure if there are at least 4 bytes left.
4346: bytereader.go:44 - (github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd.byteReader).Uint32
   └─ Uint32 returns a little endian uint32 starting at current offset.

   └─ getBits will return n bits. n can be 0.
4356: bitreader.go:60 - (*github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd.bitReader).get32BitsFast
   └─ get32BitsFast requires that at least one bit is requested every time. There are no checks if the buffer is filled.

4365: bitreader.go:120 - (*github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd.bitReader).close
   └─ close the bitstream and returns an error if out-of-buffer reads occurred.
4366: bitreader.go:105 - (*github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd.bitReader).finished
   └─ finished returns true if all bits have been read from the bit stream.

4369: decoder.go:708 - zstd.startStreamDecoder$2
4370: waitgroup.go:155 - (*sync.WaitGroup).Done
   └─ Done decrements the [WaitGroup] task counter by one. It is equivalent to Add(-1). Callers should prefer [WaitGroup.Go]. In the terminology of [the Go memory model], a call to Done "synchronizes before" the return of any Wait call that it unblocks. [the Go memory model]: https://go.dev/ref/mem
4371: waitgroup.go:77 - (*sync.WaitGroup).Add
   └─ Add adds delta, which may be negative, to the [WaitGroup] task counter. If the counter becomes zero, all goroutines blocked on [WaitGroup.Wait] are released. If the counter goes negative, Add panics. Callers should prefer [WaitGroup.Go]. Note that calls with a positive delta that occur when the counter is zero must happen before a Wait. Calls with a negative delta, or calls with a positive delta that start when the counter is greater than zero, may happen at any time. Typically this means the calls to Add should execute before the statement creating the goroutine or other event to be waited for. If a WaitGroup is reused to wait for several independent sets of events, new Add calls must happen after all previous Wait calls have returned. See the WaitGroup example.
4372: synctest.go:24 - synctest.IsInBubble
   └─ IsInBubble reports whether the current goroutine is in a bubble. go:linkname IsInBubble
4373: type.go:203 - (*sync/atomic.Uint64).Or
   └─ Or atomically performs a bitwise OR operation on x using the bitmask provided as mask and returns the old value.
4374: doc_64.go:79 - atomic.OrUint64
   └─ OrUint64 atomically performs a bitwise OR operation on *addr using the bitmask provided as mask and returns the old value. Consider using the more ergonomic and less error-prone [Uint64.Or] instead. go:noescape
4375: type.go:184 - (*sync/atomic.Uint64).Store
   └─ Store atomically stores val into x.
4376: doc_64.go:107 - atomic.StoreUint64
   └─ StoreUint64 atomically stores val into *addr. Consider using the more ergonomic and less error-prone [Uint64.Store] instead (particularly if you target 32-bit platforms; see the bugs section). go:noescape
4377: history.go:73 - (*github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd.history).append
   └─ append bytes to history. This function will make sure there is space for it, if the buffer has been allocated with enough extra space.

4380: seqdec_amd64.go:339 - (*github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd.sequenceDecs).executeSimple
   └─ executeSimple handles cases when dictionary is not used.

4400: context.go:463 - (*context.cancelCtx).Err
4401: context.go:288 - context.Cause
   └─ Cause returns a non-nil error explaining why c was canceled. The first cancellation of c or one of its parents sets the cause. If that cancellation happened via a call to CancelCauseFunc(err), then [Cause] returns err. Otherwise Cause(c) returns the same value as c.Err(). Cause returns nil if c has not been canceled yet.

4406: mgcmark.go:580 - runtime.gcAssistAlloc$2
4407: mgcmark.go:653 - runtime.gcAssistAlloc1
   └─ gcAssistAlloc1 is the part of gcAssistAlloc that runs on the system stack. This is a separate function to make it easier to see that we're not capturing anything from the user stack, since the user stack may move while we're in this function. gcAssistAlloc1 indicates whether this assist completed the mark phase by setting gp.param to non-nil. This can't be communicated on the stack since it may move. go:systemstack
4408: mgcmark.go:1319 - runtime.gcDrainN
   └─ gcDrainN blackens grey objects until it has performed roughly scanWork units of scan work or the G is preempted. This is best-effort, so it may perform less work if it fails to get a work buffer. Otherwise, it will perform at least n units of work, but may perform more because scanning is always done in whole object increments. It returns the amount of scan work performed. The caller goroutine must be in a preemptible state (e.g., _Gwaiting) to prevent deadlocks during stack scanning. As a consequence, this must be called on the system stack. go:nowritebarrier go:systemstack
4409: mgclimit.go:164 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).update
   └─ update updates the bucket given runtime-specific information. now is the current monotonic time in nanoseconds. This is safe to call concurrently with other operations, except *GCTransition.
4410: mgcwork.go:435 - runtime.getempty$1
4411: mheap.go:1039 - (*runtime.mheap).allocManual
   └─ allocManual allocates a manually-managed span of npage pages. allocManual returns nil if allocation fails. allocManual adds the bytes used to *stat, which should be a memstats in-use field. Unlike allocations in the GC'd heap, the allocation does *not* count toward heapInUse. The memory backing the returned span may not be zeroed if span.needzero is set. allocManual must be called on the system stack because it may acquire the heap lock via allocSpan. See mheap for details. If new code is written to call allocManual, do NOT use an existing spanAllocType value and instead declare a new one. go:systemstack
4412: mheap.go:996 - (runtime.spanAllocType).manual
   └─ manual returns true if the span allocation is manually managed.
4413: mheap.go:1224 - (*runtime.mheap).allocSpan
   └─ allocSpan allocates an mspan which owns npages worth of memory. If typ.manual() == false, allocSpan allocates a heap span of class spanclass and updates heap accounting. If manual == true, allocSpan allocates a manually-managed span (spanclass is ignored), and the caller is responsible for any accounting related to its use of the span. Either way, allocSpan will atomically add the bytes in the newly allocated span to *sysStat. The returned span is fully initialized. h.lock must not be held. allocSpan must be called on the system stack both because it acquires the heap lock and because it must block GC transitions. go:systemstack
4414: mpagecache.go:25 - (*runtime.pageCache).empty
   └─ empty reports whether the page cache has no free pages.
4415: mpagecache.go:119 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).allocToCache
   └─ allocToCache acquires a pageCachePages-aligned chunk of free pages which may not be contiguous, and returns a pageCache structure which owns the chunk. p.mheapLock must be held. Must run on the system stack because p.mheapLock must be held. go:systemstack
4416: mpallocbits.go:232 - (*runtime.pallocBits).find
   └─ find searches for npages contiguous free pages in pallocBits and returns the index where that run starts, as well as the index of the first free page it found in the search. searchIdx represents the first known free page and where to begin the next search from. If find fails to find any free space, it returns an index of ^uint(0) and the new searchIdx should be ignored. Note that if npages == 1, the two returned values will always be identical.
4417: mpallocbits.go:246 - (*runtime.pallocBits).find1
   └─ find1 is a helper for find which searches for a single free page in the pallocBits and returns the index. See find for an explanation of the searchIdx parameter.
4418: mpallocbits.go:268 - (*runtime.pallocBits).findSmallN
   └─ findSmallN is a helper for find which searches for npages contiguous free pages in this pallocBits and returns the index where that run of contiguous pages starts as well as the index of the first free page it finds in its search. See find for an explanation of the searchIdx parameter. Returns a ^uint(0) index on failure and the new searchIdx should be ignored. findSmallN assumes npages <= 64, where any such contiguous run of pages crosses at most one aligned 64-bit boundary in the bits.
4419: mpallocbits.go:384 - runtime.findBitRange64
   └─ findBitRange64 returns the bit index of the first set of n consecutive 1 bits. If no consecutive set of 1 bits of size n may be found in c, then it returns an integer >= 64. n must be > 0.
4420: mpallocbits.go:307 - (*runtime.pallocBits).findLargeN
   └─ findLargeN is a helper for find which searches for npages contiguous free pages in this pallocBits and returns the index where that run starts, as well as the index of the first free page it found it its search. See alloc for an explanation of the searchIdx parameter. Returns a ^uint(0) index on failure and the new searchIdx should be ignored. findLargeN assumes npages > 64, where any such run of free pages crosses at least one aligned 64-bit boundary in the bits.
4421: mpallocbits.go:376 - (*runtime.pallocBits).allocPages64
   └─ allocPages64 allocates a 64-bit block of 64 pages aligned to 64 pages according to the bits set in alloc. The block set is the one containing the i'th page.
4422: mpallocbits.go:62 - (*runtime.pageBits).setBlock64
   └─ setBlock64 sets the 64-bit aligned block of bits containing the i'th bit that are set in v.
4423: mpallocbits.go:100 - (*runtime.pageBits).clearBlock64
   └─ clearBlock64 clears the 64-bit aligned block of bits containing the i'th bit that are set in v.
4424: mgcscavenge.go:1132 - (*runtime.scavengeIndex).alloc
   └─ alloc updates metadata for chunk at index ci with the fact that an allocation of npages occurred. It also eagerly attempts to collapse the chunk's memory into hugepage if the chunk has become sufficiently dense and we're not allocating the whole chunk at once (which suggests the allocation is part of a bigger one and it's probably not worth eagerly collapsing). alloc may only run concurrently with find.
4425: mgcscavenge.go:1316 - (*runtime.scavChunkData).alloc
   └─ alloc updates sc given that npages were allocated in the corresponding chunk.
4426: mgcscavenge.go:1284 - (*runtime.scavChunkFlags).setEmpty
   └─ setEmpty clears the hasFree flag.
4427: mpagealloc.go:650 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).find
   └─ find searches for the first (address-ordered) contiguous free region of npages in size and returns a base address for that region. It uses p.searchAddr to prune its search and assumes that no palloc chunks below chunkIndex(p.searchAddr) contain any free memory at all. find also computes and returns a candidate p.searchAddr, which may or may not prune more of the address space than p.searchAddr already does. This candidate is always a valid p.searchAddr. find represents the slow path and the full radix tree search. Returns a base address of 0 on failure, in which case the candidate searchAddr returned is invalid and must be ignored. p.mheapLock must be held.
4428: mpagealloc.go:146 - runtime.offAddrToLevelIndex
   └─ offAddrToLevelIndex converts an address in the offset address space to the index into summary[level] containing addr.
4429: mpagealloc.go:152 - runtime.levelIndexToOffAddr
   └─ levelIndexToOffAddr converts an index into summary[level] into the corresponding address in the offset address space.
4430: mpagealloc.go:709 - runtime.find$1
4431: mranges.go:153 - (runtime.offAddr).lessEqual
   └─ lessEqual returns true if l1 is less than or equal to l2 in the offset address space.
4432: mranges.go:130 - (runtime.offAddr).add
   └─ add adds a uintptr offset to the offAddr.
4433: mpagealloc.go:1006 - (runtime.pallocSum).start
   └─ start extracts the start value from a packed sum.
4434: mpagealloc.go:1014 - (runtime.pallocSum).max
   └─ max extracts the max value from a packed sum.
4435: mpagealloc.go:1022 - (runtime.pallocSum).end
   └─ end extracts the end value from a packed sum.
4436: mpagealloc.go:614 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).findMappedAddr
   └─ findMappedAddr returns the smallest mapped offAddr that is >= addr. That is, if addr refers to mapped memory, then it is returned. If addr is higher than any mapped region, then it returns maxOffAddr. p.mheapLock must be held.
4437: mranges.go:310 - (*runtime.addrRanges).findAddrGreaterEqual
   └─ findAddrGreaterEqual returns the smallest address represented by a that is >= addr. Thus, if the address is represented by a, then it returns addr. The second return value indicates whether such an address exists for addr in a. That is, if addr is larger than any address known to a, the second return value will be false.
4438: mranges.go:265 - (*runtime.addrRanges).findSucc
   └─ findSucc returns the first index in a such that addr is less than the base of the addrRange at that index.
4439: mranges.go:52 - (runtime.addrRange).contains
   └─ contains returns whether or not the range contains a given address.
4440: mpagealloc.go:98 - runtime.maxSearchAddr
   └─ maxSearchAddr returns the maximum searchAddr value, which indicates that the heap has no free space. This function exists just to make it clear that this is the maximum address for the page allocator's search space. See maxOffAddr for details. It's a function (rather than a variable) because it needs to be usable before package runtime's dynamic initialization is complete. See #51913 for details.
4441: mpallocbits.go:370 - (*runtime.pallocBits).pages64
   └─ pages64 returns a 64-bit bitmap representing a block of 64 pages aligned to 64 pages. The returned block of pages is the one containing the i'th page in this pallocBits. Each bit represents whether the page is in-use.
4442: mpallocbits.go:20 - (*runtime.pageBits).block64
   └─ block64 returns the 64-bit aligned block of bits containing the i'th bit.
4443: mpagecache.go:37 - (*runtime.pageCache).alloc
   └─ alloc allocates npages from the page cache and is the main entry point for allocation. Returns a base address and the amount of scavenged memory in the allocated region in bytes. Returns a base address of zero on failure, in which case the amount of scavenged memory should be ignored.
4444: mpagecache.go:57 - (*runtime.pageCache).allocN
   └─ allocN is a helper which attempts to allocate npages worth of pages from the cache. It represents the general case for allocating from the page cache. Returns a base address and the amount of scavenged memory in the allocated region in bytes.
4445: mheap.go:1137 - (*runtime.mheap).tryAllocMSpan
   └─ tryAllocMSpan attempts to allocate an mspan object from the P-local cache, but may fail. h.lock need not be held. This caller must ensure that its P won't change underneath it during this function. Currently to ensure that we enforce that the function is run on the system stack, because that's the only place it is used now. In the future, this requirement may be relaxed if its use is necessary elsewhere. go:systemstack
4446: mheap.go:1547 - (*runtime.mheap).grow
   └─ Try to add at least npage pages of memory to the heap, returning how much the heap grew by and whether it worked. h.lock must be held.
4447: malloc.go:651 - (*runtime.mheap).sysAlloc
   └─ sysAlloc allocates heap arena space for at least n bytes. The returned pointer is always heapArenaBytes-aligned and backed by h.arenas metadata. The returned size is always a multiple of heapArenaBytes. sysAlloc returns nil on failure. There is no corresponding free function. hintList is a list of hint addresses for where to allocate new heap arenas. It must be non-nil. sysAlloc returns a memory region in the Reserved state. This region must be transitioned to Prepared and then Ready before use. arenaList is the list the arena should be added to. h must be locked.
4448: malloc.go:2038 - (*runtime.linearAlloc).alloc
4449: mem.go:176 - runtime.sysMap
   └─ sysMap transitions a memory region from Reserved to Prepared. It ensures the memory region can be efficiently transitioned to Ready. sysStat must be non-nil.

4451: mem_linux.go:116 - runtime.sysNoHugePageOS
4452: mem.go:83 - runtime.sysUsed
   └─ sysUsed transitions a memory region from Prepared to Ready. It notifies the operating system that the memory region is needed and ensures that the region may be safely accessed. This is typically a no-op on systems that don't have an explicit commit step and hard over-commit limits, but is critical on Windows, for example. This operation is idempotent for memory already in the Prepared state, so it is safe to refer, with v and n, to a range of memory that includes both Prepared and Ready memory. However, the caller must provide the exact amount of Prepared memory for accounting purposes.
4453: mem_linux.go:89 - runtime.sysUsedOS
4454: mem.go:160 - runtime.sysReserve
   └─ sysReserve transitions a memory region from None to Reserved. It reserves address space in such a way that it would cause a fatal fault upon access (either via permissions or not committing the memory). Such a reservation is thus never backed by physical memory. If the pointer passed to it is non-nil, the caller wants the reservation there, but sysReserve can still choose another location if that one is unavailable. NOTE: sysReserve returns OS-aligned memory, but the heap allocator may use larger alignment, so the caller must be careful to realign the memory obtained by sysReserve.
4455: mem_linux.go:163 - runtime.sysReserveOS
4456: mem_linux.go:154 - runtime.sysFreeOS

4457: cgo_mmap.go:50 - runtime.munmap
4458: cgo_mmap.go:66 - runtime.sysMunmap
   └─ sysMunmap calls the munmap system call. It is implemented in assembly.
4459: malloc.go:837 - runtime.sysReserveAligned
   └─ sysReserveAligned is like sysReserve, but the returned pointer is aligned to align bytes. It may reserve either n or n+align bytes, so it returns the size that was reserved.

4464: mem_linux.go:103 - runtime.sysHugePageOS
4465: mem.go:98 - runtime.sysNoHugePage
   └─ sysNoHugePage does not transition memory regions, but instead provides a hint to the OS that it would be less efficient to back this memory region with pages of a larger size transparently.
4466: race0.go:25 - runtime.racemapshadow
4467: mpagealloc.go:360 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).grow
   └─ grow sets up the metadata for the address range [base, base+size). It may allocate metadata, in which case *p.sysStat will be updated. p.mheapLock must be held.
4468: mpagealloc_64bit.go:100 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).sysGrow
   └─ sysGrow performs architecture-dependent operations on heap growth for the page allocator, such as mapping in new memory for summaries. It also updates the length of the slices in p.summary. base is the base of the newly-added heap memory and limit is the first address past the end of the newly-added heap memory. Both must be aligned to pallocChunkBytes. The caller must update p.start and p.end after calling sysGrow.
4469: mranges.go:33 - runtime.makeAddrRange
   └─ makeAddrRange creates a new address range from two virtual addresses. Throws if the base and limit are not in the same memory segment.
4470: mpagealloc_64bit.go:109 - runtime.sysGrow$1
4471: mpagealloc.go:178 - runtime.blockAlignSummaryRange
   └─ blockAlignSummaryRange aligns indices into the given level to that level's block width (1 << levelBits[level]). It assumes lo is inclusive and hi is exclusive, and so aligns them down and up respectively.
4472: mpagealloc_64bit.go:191 - (*runtime.scavengeIndex).sysGrow
   └─ sysGrow increases the index's backing store in response to a heap growth. Returns the amount of memory added to sysStat.
4473: mranges.go:60 - (runtime.addrRange).subtract
   └─ subtract takes the addrRange toPrune and cuts out any overlap with from, then returns the new range. subtract assumes that a and b either don't overlap at all, only overlap on one side, or are equal. If b is strictly contained in a, thus forcing a split, it will throw.
4474: mranges.go:42 - (runtime.addrRange).size
   └─ size returns the size of the range represented in bytes.
4475: mranges.go:141 - (runtime.offAddr).diff

   └─ sysGrow updates the index's backing store in response to a heap growth. Returns the amount of memory added to sysStat.
4479: mranges.go:336 - (*runtime.addrRanges).add
   └─ add inserts a new address range to a. r must not overlap with any address range in a and r.size() must be > 0.
4480: mranges.go:158 - (runtime.offAddr).equal
   └─ equal returns true if the two offAddr values are equal.

4483: mpagealloc.go:573 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).allocRange
   └─ allocRange marks the range of memory [base, base+npages*pageSize) as allocated. It also updates the summaries to reflect the newly-updated bitmap. Returns the amount of scavenged memory in bytes present in the allocated range. p.mheapLock must be held.
4484: mpallocbits.go:106 - (*runtime.pageBits).popcntRange
   └─ popcntRange counts the number of set bits in the range [i, i+n).
4485: mpallocbits.go:426 - (*runtime.pallocData).allocRange
   └─ allocRange sets bits [i, i+n) in the bitmap to 1 and updates the scavenged bits appropriately.
4486: mpallocbits.go:343 - (*runtime.pallocBits).allocRange
   └─ allocRange allocates the range [i, i+n).

   └─ setAll sets all the bits of b.
4490: mpagealloc.go:875 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).alloc
   └─ alloc allocates npages worth of memory from the page heap, returning the base address for the allocation and the amount of scavenged memory in bytes contained in the region [base address, base address + npages*pageSize). Returns a 0 base address on failure, in which case other returned values should be ignored. p.mheapLock must be held. Must run on the system stack because p.mheapLock must be held. go:systemstack
4491: mheap.go:1160 - (*runtime.mheap).allocMSpanLocked
   └─ allocMSpanLocked allocates an mspan object. h.lock must be held. allocMSpanLocked must be called on the system stack because its caller holds the heap lock. See mheap for details. Running on the system stack also ensures that we won't switch Ps during this function. See tryAllocMSpan for details. go:systemstack
4492: mgcscavenge.go:675 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).scavenge
   └─ scavenge scavenges nbytes worth of free pages, starting with the highest address first. Successive calls continue from where it left off until the heap is exhausted. force makes all memory available to scavenge, ignoring huge page heuristics. Returns the amount of memory scavenged in bytes. scavenge always tries to scavenge nbytes worth of memory, and will only fail to do so if the heap is exhausted for now.
4493: mgcscavenge.go:1078 - (*runtime.scavengeIndex).find
   └─ find returns the highest chunk index that may contain pages available to scavenge. It also returns an offset to start searching in the highest chunk.
4494: mgcscavenge.go:1295 - (runtime.scavChunkData).shouldScavenge
   └─ shouldScavenge returns true if the corresponding chunk should be interrogated by the scavenger.

   └─ isEmpty returns true if the hasFree flag is unset.
4496: mranges.go:179 - (*runtime.atomicOffAddr).Clear

4497: types.go:89 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Int64).CompareAndSwap
   └─ CompareAndSwap atomically compares i's value with old, and if they're equal, swaps i's value with new. It reports whether the swap ran. go:nosplit
4498: stubs.go:21 - atomic.Casint64
   └─ go:noescape
4499: mranges.go:210 - (*runtime.atomicOffAddr).StoreUnmark
   └─ StoreUnmark attempts to unmark the value in atomicOffAddr and replace it with newAddr. markedAddr must be a marked address returned by Load. This function will not store newAddr if the box no longer contains markedAddr.
4500: mranges.go:193 - (*runtime.atomicOffAddr).StoreMin
   └─ StoreMin stores addr if it's less than the current value in the offset address space if the current value is not marked.
4501: mheap.go:1439 - (*runtime.mheap).initSpan
   └─ initSpan initializes a blank span s which will represent the range [base, base+npages*pageSize). typ is the type of span being allocated.
4502: mheap.go:1785 - (*runtime.mspan).init
   └─ Initialize a new span with the given start and npages.
4503: mheap.go:1072 - (*runtime.mheap).allocNeedsZero
   └─ allocNeedsZero checks if the region of address space [base, base+npage*pageSize), assumed to be allocated, needs to be zeroed, updating heap arena metadata for future allocations. This must be called each time pages are allocated from the heap, even if the page allocator can otherwise prove the memory it's allocating is already zero because they're fresh from the operating system. It updates heapArena metadata that is critical for future page allocations. There are no locking constraints on this method.
4504: mheap.go:1048 - (*runtime.mheap).setSpans
   └─ setSpans modifies the span map so [spanOf(base), spanOf(base+npage*pageSize)) is s.
4505: mheap.go:2977 - runtime.newAllocBits
   └─ newAllocBits returns a pointer to 8 byte aligned bytes to be used for this span's alloc bits. newAllocBits is used to provide newly initialized spans allocation bits. For spans not being initialized the mark bits are repurposed as allocation bits when the span is swept.
4506: valgrind0.go:21 - runtime.valgrindMempoolMalloc

4511: proc.go:2134 - runtime.forEachPInternal
   └─ forEachPInternal calls fn(p) for every P p when p reaches a GC safe point. It is the internal implementation of forEachP. The caller must hold worldsema and either must ensure that a GC is not running (otherwise this may deadlock with the GC trying to preempt this P) or it must leave its goroutine in a preemptible state before it switches to the systemstack. Due to these restrictions, prefer forEachP when possible. go:systemstack

4515: mgcmark.go:121 - runtime.gcMarkRootCheck
   └─ gcMarkRootCheck checks that all roots have been scanned. It is purely for debugging.
4516: mgcpacer.go:858 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).resetLive
   └─ resetLive sets up the controller state for the next mark phase after the end of the previous one. Must be called after endCycle and before commit, before the world is started. The world must be stopped.
4517: mgc.go:1070 - runtime.gcMarkTermination$2
4518: mcheckmark.go:126 - runtime.runCheckmark
   └─ runCheckmark runs a full non-parallel, stop-the-world mark using checkmark bits, to check that we didn't forget to mark anything during the concurrent mark process. The world must be stopped to call runCheckmark.

4531: mgc.go:1717 - runtime.gcSweep
   └─ gcSweep must be called on the system stack because it acquires the heap lock. See mheap for details. Returns true if the heap was fully swept by this function. The world must be stopped. go:systemstack
4532: mgcsweep.go:220 - (*runtime.activeSweep).reset
   └─ reset sets up the activeSweep for the next sweep cycle. The world must be stopped.
4533: mgcsweep.go:81 - (*runtime.sweepClass).clear
4534: mgcwork.go:526 - runtime.freeSomeWbufs
   └─ freeSomeWbufs frees some workbufs back to the heap and returns true if it should be called again to free more.
4535: mgcpacer.go:1459 - runtime.gcControllerCommit
   └─ gcControllerCommit is gcController.commit, but passes arguments from live (non-test) data. It also updates any consumers of the GC pacing, such as sweep pacing and the background scavenger. Calls gcController.commit. The heap lock must be held, so this must be executed on the system stack. go:systemstack
4536: mgcsweep.go:457 - runtime.isSweepDone
   └─ isSweepDone reports whether all spans are swept. Note that this condition may transition from false to true at any time as the sweeper runs. It may transition from true to false if a GC runs; to prevent that the caller must be non-preemptible or must somehow block GC progress.
4537: mgcsweep.go:213 - (*runtime.activeSweep).isDone
   └─ isDone returns true if all sweep work has been drained and no more outstanding sweepers exist. That is, when the sweep phase is completely done.
4538: mgcpacer.go:1217 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).commit
   └─ commit recomputes all pacing parameters needed to derive the trigger and the heap goal. Namely, the gcPercent-based heap goal, and the amount of runway we want to give the GC this cycle. This can be called any time. If GC is the in the middle of a concurrent phase, it will adjust the pacing of that phase. isSweepDone should be the result of calling isSweepDone(), unless we're testing or we know we're executing during a GC cycle. This depends on gcPercent, gcController.heapMarked, and gcController.heapLive. These must be up to date. Callers must call gcControllerState.revise after calling this function if the GC is enabled. mheap_.lock must be held or the world must be stopped.
4539: traceruntime.go:575 - (runtime.traceLocker).HeapGoal
   └─ HeapGoal reads the current heap goal and emits a HeapGoal event.
4540: mgcsweep.go:981 - runtime.gcPaceSweeper
   └─ gcPaceSweeper updates the sweeper's pacing parameters. Must be called whenever the GC's pacing is updated. The world must be stopped, or mheap_.lock must be held.
4541: mgcscavenge.go:167 - runtime.gcPaceScavenger
   └─ gcPaceScavenger updates the scavenger's pacing, particularly its rate and RSS goal. For this, it requires the current heapGoal, and the heapGoal for the previous GC cycle. The RSS goal is based on the current heap goal with a small overhead to accommodate non-determinism in the allocator. The pacing is based on scavengePageRate, which applies to both regular and huge pages. See that constant for more information. Must be called whenever GC pacing is updated. mheap_.lock must be held or the world must be stopped.
4542: mgc.go:1187 - runtime.gcMarkTermination$3

4544: mgc.go:1327 - runtime.gcMarkTermination$5
4545: malloc.go:899 - (*runtime.mheap).enableMetadataHugePages
   └─ enableMetadataHugePages enables huge pages for various sources of heap metadata. A note on latency: for sufficiently small heaps (<10s of GiB) this function will take constant time, but may take time proportional to the size of the mapped heap beyond that. This function is idempotent. The heap lock must not be held over this operation, since it will briefly acquire the heap lock. Must be called on the system stack because it acquires the heap lock. go:systemstack
4546: mpagealloc.go:447 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).enableChunkHugePages
   └─ enableChunkHugePages enables huge pages for the chunk bitmap mappings (disabled by default). This function is idempotent.

   └─ stackfree frees an n byte stack allocation at stk. stackfree must run on the system stack because it uses per-P resources and must not split the stack. go:systemstack
4550: mem.go:121 - runtime.sysFree
   └─ sysFree transitions a memory region from any state to None. Therefore, it returns memory unconditionally. It is used if an out-of-memory error has been detected midway through an allocation or to carve out an aligned section of the address space. It is okay if sysFree is a no-op only if sysReserve always returns a memory region aligned to the heap allocator's alignment restrictions. sysStat must be non-nil. Don't split the stack as this function may be invoked without a valid G, which prevents us from allocating more stack. go:nosplit

   └─ SetFloat64 sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z. If z's precision is 0, it is changed to 53 (and rounding will have no effect). SetFloat64 panics with [ErrNaN] if x is a NaN.
4603: signbit.go:8 - math.Signbit
   └─ Signbit reports whether x is negative or negative zero.

4611: tracestring.go:31 - runtime.put$1
4612: tracestring.go:53 - (*runtime.traceStringTable).writeString
   └─ writeString writes the string to t.buf. Must run on the systemstack because it acquires t.lock. go:systemstack
4613: tracebuf.go:64 - runtime.unsafeTraceWriter
   └─ unsafeTraceWriter produces a traceWriter that doesn't lock the trace. It should only be used in contexts where either: - Another traceLocker is held. - trace.gen is prevented from advancing. This does not have the same stack growth restrictions as traceLocker.writer. buf may be nil.
4614: tracebuf.go:327 - (*runtime.traceBuf).stringData
   └─ stringData appends s's data directly to buf. nosplit because it's part of writing an event for an M, which must not have any stack growth. go:nosplit
4615: mheap.go:1011 - runtime.alloc$1
4616: mheap.go:832 - (*runtime.mheap).reclaim
   └─ reclaim sweeps and reclaims at least npage pages into the heap. It is called before allocating npage pages to keep growth in check. reclaim implements the page-reclaimer half of the sweeper. h.lock must NOT be held.
4617: mheap.go:912 - (*runtime.mheap).reclaimChunk
   └─ reclaimChunk sweeps unmarked spans that start at page indexes [pageIdx, pageIdx+n). It returns the number of pages returned to the heap. h.lock must be held and the caller must be non-preemptible. Note: h.lock may be temporarily unlocked and re-locked in order to do sweeping or if tracing is enabled.

4623: mprof.go:740 - runtime.captureStack$1
4624: mgcmark.go:301 - runtime.markrootFreeGStacks
   └─ markrootFreeGStacks frees stacks of dead Gs. This does not free stacks of dead Gs cached on Ps, but having a few cached stacks around isn't a problem.
4625: mgcmark.go:222 - runtime.markroot$1
4626: preempt.go:105 - runtime.suspendG
   └─ suspendG suspends goroutine gp at a safe-point and returns the state of the suspended goroutine. The caller gets read access to the goroutine until it calls resumeG. It is safe for multiple callers to attempt to suspend the same goroutine at the same time. The goroutine may execute between subsequent successful suspend operations. The current implementation grants exclusive access to the goroutine, and hence multiple callers will serialize. However, the intent is to grant shared read access, so please don't depend on exclusive access. This must be called from the system stack and the user goroutine on the current M (if any) must be in a preemptible state. This prevents deadlocks where two goroutines attempt to suspend each other and both are in non-preemptible states. There are other ways to resolve this deadlock, but this seems simplest. TODO(austin): What if we instead required this to be called from a user goroutine? Then we could deschedule the goroutine while waiting instead of blocking the thread. If two goroutines tried to suspend each other, one of them would win and the other wouldn't complete the suspend until it was resumed. We would have to be careful that they couldn't actually queue up suspend for each other and then both be suspended. This would also avoid the need for a kernel context switch in the synchronous case because we could just directly schedule the waiter. The context switch is unavoidable in the signal case. go:systemstack
4627: proc.go:1405 - runtime.casGFromPreempted
   └─ casGFromPreempted attempts to transition gp from _Gpreempted to _Gwaiting. If successful, the caller is responsible for re-scheduling gp.
4628: proc.go:1226 - runtime.castogscanstatus
   └─ This will return false if the gp is not in the expected status and the cas fails. This acts like a lock acquire while the casfromgstatus acts like a lock release.
4629: proc.go:1198 - runtime.casfrom_Gscanstatus
   └─ The Gscanstatuses are acting like locks and this releases them. If it proves to be a performance hit we should be able to make these simple atomic stores but for now we are going to throw if we see an inconsistent state.
4630: mgcmark.go:856 - runtime.scanstack
   └─ scanstack scans gp's stack, greying all pointers found on the stack. Returns the amount of scan work performed, but doesn't update gcController.stackScanWork or flush any credit. Any background credit produced by this function should be flushed by its caller. scanstack itself can't safely flush because it may result in trying to wake up a goroutine that was just scanned, resulting in a self-deadlock. scanstack will also shrink the stack if it is safe to do so. If it is not, it schedules a stack shrink for the next synchronous safe point. scanstack is marked go:systemstack because it must not be preempted while using a workbuf. go:nowritebarrier go:systemstack
4631: stack.go:1197 - runtime.isShrinkStackSafe
   └─ isShrinkStackSafe returns whether it's safe to attempt to shrink gp's stack. Shrinking the stack is only safe when we have precise pointer maps for all frames on the stack. The caller must hold the _Gscan bit for gp or must be running gp itself.
4632: stack.go:1235 - runtime.shrinkstack
   └─ Maybe shrink the stack being used by gp. gp must be stopped and we must own its stack. It may be in _Grunning, but only if this is our own user G.
4633: stack.go:899 - runtime.copystack
   └─ Copies gp's stack to a new stack of a different size. Caller must have changed gp status to Gcopystack.

4643: stack.go:820 - runtime.adjustsudogs
4644: stack.go:701 - runtime.adjustframe
   └─ Note: the argument/return area is adjusted by the callee.
4645: stkframe.go:157 - (*runtime.stkframe).getStackMap
   └─ getStackMap returns the locals and arguments live pointer maps, and stack object list for frame.
4646: stkframe.go:94 - (*runtime.stkframe).argMapInternal
   └─ argMapInternal is used internally by stkframe to fetch special argument maps. argMap.n is always populated with the size of the argument map. argMap.bytedata is only populated for dynamic argument maps (used by reflect). If the caller requires the argument map, it should use this if non-nil, and otherwise fetch the argument map using the current PC. hasReflectStackObj indicates that this frame also has a reflect function stack object, which the caller must synthesize.
4647: symtab.go:1323 - runtime.stackmapdata
   └─ go:nowritebarrier
4648: stack.go:652 - runtime.adjustpointers
   └─ bv describes the memory starting at address scanp. Adjust any pointers contained therein.
4649: stack.go:645 - (*runtime.bitvector).ptrbit
   └─ ptrbit returns the i'th bit in bv. ptrbit is less efficient than iterating directly over bitvector bits, and should only be used in non-performance-critical code. See adjustpointers for an example of a high-efficiency walk of a bitvector.
4650: intrinsics.go:72 - sys.TrailingZeros8
   └─ TrailingZeros8 returns the number of trailing zero bits in x; the result is 8 for x == 0.
4651: stack.go:1340 - (*runtime.stackObjectRecord).gcdata
   └─ gcdata returns the number of bytes that contain pointers, and a ptr/nonptr bitmask covering those bytes. Note that this bitmask might be larger than internal/abi.MaxPtrmaskBytes.

   └─ argBytes returns the argument frame size for a call to frame.fn.
4655: mgcmark.go:1547 - runtime.scanConservative
   └─ scanConservative scans block [b, b+n) conservatively, treating any pointer-like value in the block as a pointer. If ptrmask != nil, only words that are marked in ptrmask are considered as potential pointers. If state != nil, it's assumed that [b, b+n) is a block in the stack and may contain pointers to stack objects.
4656: mgcstack.go:270 - (*runtime.stackScanState).addObject
   └─ addObject adds a stack object at addr of type typ to the set of stack objects.
4657: mgcstack.go:160 - (*runtime.stackObject).setRecord
   └─ obj.r = r, but with no write barrier. go:nowritebarrier
4658: mgcstack.go:302 - (*runtime.stackScanState).buildIndex
   └─ buildIndex initializes s.root to a binary search tree. It should be called after all addObject calls but before any call of findObject.
4659: mgcstack.go:311 - runtime.binarySearchTree [RECURSIVE]
   └─ Build a binary search tree with the n objects in the list x.obj[idx], x.obj[idx+1], ..., x.next.obj[0], ... Returns the root of that tree, and the buf+idx of the nth object after x.obj[idx]. (The first object that was not included in the binary search tree.) If n == 0, returns nil, x.
4660: mgcstack.go:237 - (*runtime.stackScanState).getPtr
   └─ Remove and return a potential pointer to a stack object. Returns 0 if there are no more pointers available. This prefers non-conservative pointers so we scan stack objects precisely if there are any non-conservative pointers to them.
4661: mgcstack.go:331 - (*runtime.stackScanState).findObject
   └─ findObject returns the stack object containing address a, if any. Must have called buildIndex previously.
4662: preempt.go:258 - runtime.resumeG

   └─ asyncPreempt saves all user registers and calls asyncPreempt2. When stack scanning encounters an asyncPreempt frame, it scans that frame and its parent frame conservatively. asyncPreempt is implemented in assembly.
4673: stubs.go:434 - runtime.sigpanic0
   └─ Injected by the signal handler for panicking signals. Initializes any registers that have fixed meaning at calls but are scratch in bodies and calls sigpanic. On many platforms it just jumps to sigpanic.

4679: mgcscavenge.go:682 - runtime.scavenge$1
4680: mgcscavenge.go:732 - (*runtime.pageAlloc).scavengeOne
   └─ scavengeOne walks over the chunk at chunk index ci and searches for a contiguous run of pages to scavenge. It will try to scavenge at most max bytes at once, but may scavenge more to avoid breaking huge pages. Once it scavenges some memory it returns how much it scavenged in bytes. searchIdx is the page index to start searching from in ci. Returns the number of bytes scavenged. Must run on the systemstack because it acquires p.mheapLock. go:systemstack
4681: mgcscavenge.go:894 - (*runtime.pallocData).findScavengeCandidate
   └─ findScavengeCandidate returns a start index and a size for this pallocData segment which represents a contiguous region of free and unscavenged memory. searchIdx indicates the page index within this chunk to start the search, but note that findScavengeCandidate searches backwards through the pallocData. As a result, it will return the highest scavenge candidate in address order. min indicates a hard minimum size and alignment for runs of pages. That is, findScavengeCandidate will not return a region smaller than min pages in size, or that is min pages or greater in size but not aligned to min. min must be a non-zero power of 2 <= maxPagesPerPhysPage. max is a hint for how big of a region is desired. If max >= pallocChunkPages, then findScavengeCandidate effectively returns entire free and unscavenged regions. If max < pallocChunkPages, it may truncate the returned region such that size is max. However, findScavengeCandidate may still return a larger region if, for example, it chooses to preserve huge pages, or if max is not aligned to min (it will round up). That is, even if max is small, the returned size is not guaranteed to be equal to max. max is allowed to be less than min, in which case it is as if max == min.
4682: mgcscavenge.go:823 - runtime.fillAligned
   └─ fillAligned returns x but with all zeroes in m-aligned groups of m bits set to 1 if any bit in the group is non-zero. For example, fillAligned(0x0100a3, 8) == 0xff00ff. Note that if m == 1, this is a no-op. m must be a power of 2 <= maxPagesPerPhysPage.
4683: mgcscavenge.go:824 - runtime.fillAligned$1
4684: mgcscavenge.go:1187 - (*runtime.scavengeIndex).setEmpty
   └─ setEmpty marks that the scavenger has finished looking at ci for now to prevent the scavenger from getting stuck looking at the same chunk. setEmpty may only run concurrently with find.
4685: mem.go:68 - runtime.sysUnused
   └─ sysUnused transitions a memory region from Ready to Prepared. It notifies the operating system that the physical pages backing this memory region are no longer needed and can be reused for other purposes. The contents of a sysUnused memory region are considered forfeit and the region must not be accessed again until sysUsed is called.

4696: constant.go:379 - tree.commonConstantType
   └─ commonConstantType returns the most constrained type which is mutually resolvable between a set of provided constants. The function takes a slice of Exprs and indexes, but expects all the indexed Exprs to wrap a Constant. The reason it does no take a slice of Constants instead is to avoid forcing callers to allocate separate slices of Constant.
4697: constant.go:510 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/sem/tree.StrVal).DesirableTypes
   └─ DesirableTypes implements the Constant interface.

   └─ CheckIsWindowOrAgg returns an error if the function definition is not a window function or an aggregate.
4703: type_check.go:2077 - tree.typeCheckSameTypedTupleExprs
   └─ typeCheckSameTypedTupleExprs type checks a list of expressions, asserting that all are tuples which have the same type or nulls. The function expects the first provided expression to be a tuple, and will panic if it is not. However, it does not expect all other expressions are tuples or nulls, and will return a sane error if they are not. An optional desired type can be provided, which will hint that type which the expressions should resolve to, if possible.
4704: type_check.go:2137 - tree.checkAllExprsAreTuplesOrNulls
   └─ checkAllExprsAreTuplesOrNulls checks that all expressions in exprs are either tuples or nulls.
4705: type_check.go:230 - tree.unexpectedTypeError
4706: type_check.go:2154 - tree.checkAllTuplesHaveLength

   └─ Used to set placeholders to the desired typ.

   └─ Is p all zeros?
5067: ip.go:391 - (net.IP).Equal
   └─ Equal reports whether ip and x are the same IP address. An IPv4 address and that same address in IPv6 form are considered to be equal.
5068: equal_generic.go:14 - bytealg.Equal
   └─ Equal reports whether a and b are the same length and contain the same bytes. A nil argument is equivalent to an empty slice. Equal is equivalent to bytes.Equal. It is provided here for convenience, because some packages cannot depend on bytes.
5069: ip.go:296 - (net.IP).String
   └─ String returns the string form of the IP address ip. It returns one of 4 forms: - "<nil>", if ip has length 0 - dotted decimal ("192.0.2.1"), if ip is an IPv4 or IP4-mapped IPv6 address - IPv6 conforming to RFC 5952 ("2001:db8::1"), if ip is a valid IPv6 address - the hexadecimal form of ip, without punctuation, if no other cases apply

   └─ appendTo appends the string representation of ip to b and returns the expanded b If len(ip) != IPv4len or IPv6len, it appends nothing.
5072: netip.go:349 - netip.AddrFromSlice
   └─ AddrFromSlice parses the 4- or 16-byte byte slice as an IPv4 or IPv6 address. Note that a [net.IP] can be passed directly as the []byte argument. If slice's length is not 4 or 16, AddrFromSlice returns [Addr]{}, false.
5073: netip.go:802 - (net/netip.Addr).AppendTo

5077: netip.go:468 - (net/netip.Addr).Is4In6
   └─ Is4In6 reports whether ip is an "IPv4-mapped IPv6 address" as defined by RFC 4291. That is, it reports whether ip is in ::ffff:0:0/96.
5078: netip.go:881 - (net/netip.Addr).appendTo4In6
5079: netip.go:482 - (net/netip.Addr).Unmap
   └─ Unmap returns ip with any IPv4-mapped IPv6 address prefix removed. That is, if ip is an IPv6 address wrapping an IPv4 address, it returns the wrapped IPv4 address. Otherwise it returns ip unmodified.
5080: netip.go:910 - (net/netip.Addr).appendTo6
5081: netip.go:373 - (net/netip.Addr).v6u16
   └─ v6u16 returns the i'th 16-bit word of ip. If ip is an IPv4 address, this accesses the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address form of the IP.
5082: uint128.go:67 - (*net/netip.uint128).halves
   └─ halves returns the two uint64 halves of the uint128. Logically, think of it as returning two uint64s. It only returns pointers for inlining reasons on 32-bit platforms.
5083: netip.go:835 - netip.appendHex

5131: collate.go:56 - collate.New
   └─ New returns a new Collator initialized for the given locale.
5132: colltab.go:25 - colltab.MatchLang
   └─ MatchLang finds the index of t in tags, using a matching algorithm used for collation and search. tags[0] must be language.Und, the remaining tags should be sorted alphabetically. Language matching for collation and search is different from the matching defined by language.Matcher: the (inferred) base language must be an exact match for the relevant fields. For example, "gsw" should not match "de". Also the parent relation is different, as a parent may have a different script. So usually the parent of zh-Hant is und, whereas for MatchLang it is zh.
5133: language.go:188 - (golang.org/x/text/language.CanonType).Canonicalize
   └─ Canonicalize returns the canonicalized equivalent of the tag.

5135: language.go:76 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language/compact.Tag).IsCompact
   └─ IsCompact reports whether this tag is fully defined in terms of ID.
5136: language.go:246 - (golang.org/x/text/language.Tag).Base
   └─ Base returns the base language of the language tag. If the base language is unspecified, an attempt will be made to infer it from the context. It uses a variant of CLDR's Add Likely Subtags algorithm. This is subject to change.
5137: language.go:37 - (*golang.org/x/text/language.Tag).lang
   └─ TODO: improve performance.
5138: language.go:530 - (golang.org/x/text/internal/language.Region).IsCountry

5139: lookup.go:327 - (golang.org/x/text/internal/language.Region).IsPrivateUse
   └─ IsPrivateUse reports whether r has the ISO 3166 User-assigned status. This may include private-use tags that are assigned by CLDR and used in this implementation. So IsPrivateUse and IsCountry can be simultaneously true.
5140: lookup.go:283 - (golang.org/x/text/internal/language.Region).typ
5141: language.go:539 - (golang.org/x/text/internal/language.Region).IsGroup
   └─ IsGroup returns whether this region defines a collection of regions. This includes non-standard definitions from CLDR.
5142: parse.go:89 - (golang.org/x/text/language.CanonType).Compose
   └─ Compose creates a Tag from individual parts, which may be of type Tag, Base, Script, Region, Variant, []Variant, Extension, []Extension or error. If a Base, Script or Region or slice of type Variant or Extension is passed more than once, the latter will overwrite the former. Variants and Extensions are accumulated, but if two extensions of the same type are passed, the latter will replace the former. For -u extensions, though, the key-type pairs are added, where later values overwrite older ones. A Tag overwrites all former values and typically only makes sense as the first argument. The resulting tag is returned after canonicalizing using CanonType c. If one or more errors are encountered, one of the errors is returned.
5143: parse.go:107 - language.update
5144: compose.go:98 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.Builder).SetExt
   └─ SetExt sets the extension e to the tag. e must be a valid extension as returned by Tag.Extension. If the extension already exists, it will be overwritten, except for a -u extension, where the individual key-type pairs will be set.
5145: compose.go:127 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.Builder).ClearVariants
   └─ ClearVariants removes any variants previously added, including those copied from a Tag in SetTag.
5146: compose.go:133 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/language.Builder).ClearExtensions
   └─ ClearExtensions removes any extensions previously added, including those copied from a Tag in SetTag.
5147: language.go:343 - (golang.org/x/text/language.Tag).Parent
   └─ Parent returns the CLDR parent of t. In CLDR, missing fields in data for a specific language are substituted with fields from the parent language. The parent for a language may change for newer versions of CLDR. Parent returns a tag for a less specific language that is mutually intelligible or Und if there is no such language. This may not be the same as simply stripping the last BCP 47 subtag. For instance, the parent of "zh-TW" is "zh-Hant", and the parent of "zh-Hant" is "und".
5148: language.go:105 - (golang.org/x/text/internal/language/compact.Tag).Parent
   └─ Parent returns the CLDR parent of t. In CLDR, missing fields in data for a specific language are substituted with fields from the parent language. The parent for a language may change for newer versions of CLDR.
5149: language.go:400 - (golang.org/x/text/language.Tag).Extensions
   └─ Extensions returns all extensions of t.
5150: language.go:88 - (golang.org/x/text/internal/language/compact.Tag).MayHaveExtensions
   └─ MayHaveExtensions reports whether a tag may have extensions. If it returns false it is guaranteed the tag does not have them.
5151: language.go:419 - (golang.org/x/text/language.Tag).TypeForKey
   └─ TypeForKey returns the type associated with the given key, where key and type are of the allowed values defined for the Unicode locale extension ('u') in https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers. TypeForKey will traverse the inheritance chain to get the correct value. If there are multiple types associated with a key, only the first will be returned. If there is no type associated with a key, it returns the empty string.
5152: language.go:432 - (golang.org/x/text/language.Tag).SetTypeForKey
   └─ SetTypeForKey returns a new Tag with the key set to type, where key and type are of the allowed values defined for the Unicode locale extension ('u') in https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers. An empty value removes an existing pair with the same key.
5153: colltab.go:91 - colltab.parent
   └─ parent computes the structural parent. This means inheritance may change script. So, unlike the CLDR parent, parent(zh-Hant) == zh.
5154: index.go:11 - collate.getTable

5164: table.go:100 - (*golang.org/x/text/internal/colltab.Table).appendNext [RECURSIVE]
   └─ appendNext appends the weights corresponding to the next rune or contraction in s.  If a contraction is matched to a discontinuous sequence of runes, the weights for the interstitial runes are appended as well.  It returns a new slice that includes the appended weights and the number of bytes consumed from s.

5349: array_encoding.go:112 - ondisk.DecodeArray
5350: varint.go:130 - binary.ReadUvarint
   └─ ReadUvarint reads an encoded unsigned integer from r and returns it as a uint64. The error is [io.EOF] only if no bytes were read. If an [io.EOF] happens after reading some but not all the bytes, ReadUvarint returns [io.ErrUnexpectedEOF].
5351: array_encoding.go:69 - ondisk.decodeTypedValue
   └─ decodeTypedValue decodes a single typed value from the reader. This is the canonical place for all type-specific decoding logic.
5352: array_encoding.go:207 - ondisk.readBytes
5353: binary.go:258 - binary.Read
   └─ Read reads structured binary data from r into data. Data must be a pointer to a fixed-size value or a slice of fixed-size values. Bytes read from r are decoded using the specified byte order and written to successive fields of the data. When decoding boolean values, a zero byte is decoded as false, and any other non-zero byte is decoded as true. When reading into structs, the field data for fields with blank (_) field names is skipped; i.e., blank field names may be used for padding. When reading into a struct, all non-blank fields must be exported or Read may panic. The error is [io.EOF] only if no bytes were read. If an [io.EOF] happens after reading some but not all the bytes, Read returns [io.ErrUnexpectedEOF].
5354: binary.go:990 - binary.intDataSize
   └─ intDataSize returns the size of the data required to represent the data when encoded, and optionally a byte slice containing the encoded data if no conversion is necessary. It returns zero, nil if the type cannot be implemented by the fast path in Read or Write.
5355: io.go:353 - io.ReadFull
   └─ ReadFull reads exactly len(buf) bytes from r into buf. It returns the number of bytes copied and an error if fewer bytes were read. The error is EOF only if no bytes were read. If an EOF happens after reading some but not all the bytes, ReadFull returns [ErrUnexpectedEOF]. On return, n == len(buf) if and only if err == nil. If r returns an error having read at least len(buf) bytes, the error is dropped.
5356: io.go:329 - io.ReadAtLeast
   └─ ReadAtLeast reads from r into buf until it has read at least min bytes. It returns the number of bytes copied and an error if fewer bytes were read. The error is EOF only if no bytes were read. If an EOF happens after reading fewer than min bytes, ReadAtLeast returns [ErrUnexpectedEOF]. If min is greater than the length of buf, ReadAtLeast returns [ErrShortBuffer]. On return, n >= min if and only if err == nil. If r returns an error having read at least min bytes, the error is dropped.

5360: binary.go:155 - (encoding/binary.bigEndian).Uint16
   └─ Uint16 returns the uint16 representation of b[0:2].
5361: binary.go:698 - binary.dataSize
   └─ dataSize returns the number of bytes the actual data represented by v occupies in memory. For compound structures, it sums the sizes of the elements. Thus, for instance, for a slice it returns the length of the slice times the element size and does not count the memory occupied by the header. If the type of v is not acceptable, dataSize returns -1.
5362: binary.go:733 - binary.sizeof [RECURSIVE]
   └─ sizeof returns the size >= 0 of variables for the given type or -1 if the type is not acceptable.

   └─ v is a method receiver. Store at p the word which is used to encode that receiver at the start of the argument list. Reflect uses the "interface" calling convention for methods, which always uses one word to record the receiver.
5473: abi.go:480 - reflect.intToReg
   └─ intToReg loads an argSize sized integer and stores it into reg. argSize must be non-zero, fit in a register, and a power-of-two.
5474: abi.go:74 - (*internal/abi.RegArgs).IntRegArgAddr
   └─ IntRegArgAddr returns a pointer inside of r.Ints[reg] that is appropriately offset for an argument of size argSize. argSize must be non-zero, fit in a register, and a power-of-two. This method is a helper for dealing with the endianness of different CPU architectures, since sub-word-sized arguments in big endian architectures need to be "aligned" to the upper edge of the register to be interpreted by the CPU correctly.
5475: value.go:3733 - reflect.memmove
   └─ memmove copies size bytes to dst from src. No write barriers are used. go:noescape
5476: abi.go:501 - reflect.floatToReg
   └─ floatToReg stores a float value in its register representation in r. argSize must be either 4 or 8.

5479: mgc.go:481 - runtime.GC
   └─ GC runs a garbage collection and blocks the caller until the garbage collection is complete. It may also block the entire program.
5480: mgc.go:555 - runtime.gcWaitOnMark
   └─ gcWaitOnMark blocks until GC finishes the Nth mark phase. If GC has already completed this mark phase, it returns immediately.
5481: mprof.go:420 - runtime.mProf_PostSweep
   └─ mProf_PostSweep records that all sweep frees for this GC cycle have completed. This has the effect of publishing the heap profile snapshot as of the last mark termination without advancing the heap profile cycle.
5482: value.go:3726 - reflect.call
   └─ call calls fn with "stackArgsSize" bytes of stack arguments laid out at stackArgs and register arguments laid out in regArgs. frameSize is the total amount of stack space that will be reserved by call, so this should include enough space to spill register arguments to the stack in case of preemption. After fn returns, call copies stackArgsSize-stackRetOffset result bytes back into stackArgs+stackRetOffset before returning, for any return values passed on the stack. Register-based return values will be found in the same regArgs structure. regArgs must also be prepared with an appropriate ReturnIsPtr bitmap indicating which registers will contain pointer-valued return values. The purpose of this bitmap is to keep pointers visible to the GC between returning from reflectcall and actually using them. If copying result bytes back from the stack, the caller must pass the argument frame type as stackArgsType, so that call can execute appropriate write barriers during the copy. Arguments passed through to call do not escape. The type is used only in a very limited callee of call, the stackArgs are copied, and regArgs is only used in the call frame. go:noescape go:linkname call runtime.reflectcall
5483: value.go:3749 - reflect.typedmemclrpartial
   └─ typedmemclrpartial is like typedmemclr but assumes that dst points off bytes into the value and only clears size bytes. go:noescape
5484: abi.go:473 - reflect.intFromReg
   └─ intFromReg loads an argSize sized integer from reg and places it at to. argSize must be non-zero, fit in a register, and a power-of-two.
5485: abi.go:487 - reflect.floatFromReg
   └─ floatFromReg loads a float value from its register representation in r. argSize must be 4 or 8.

5489: makefunc.go:46 - reflect.MakeFunc
   └─ MakeFunc returns a new function of the given [Type] that wraps the function fn. When called, that new function does the following: - converts its arguments to a slice of Values. - runs results := fn(args). - returns the results as a slice of Values, one per formal result. The implementation fn can assume that the argument [Value] slice has the number and type of arguments given by typ. If typ describes a variadic function, the final Value is itself a slice representing the variadic arguments, as in the body of a variadic function. The result Value slice returned by fn must have the number and type of results given by typ. The [Value.Call] method allows the caller to invoke a typed function in terms of Values; in contrast, MakeFunc allows the caller to implement a typed function in terms of Values. The Examples section of the documentation includes an illustration of how to use MakeFunc to build a swap function for different types.

   └─ MapRange returns a range iterator for a map. It panics if v's Kind is not [Map]. Call [MapIter.Next] to advance the iterator, and [MapIter.Key]/[MapIter.Value] to access each entry. [MapIter.Next] returns false when the iterator is exhausted. MapRange follows the same iteration semantics as a range statement. Example: iter := reflect.ValueOf(m).MapRange() for iter.Next() { k := iter.Key() v := iter.Value() ... }
5501: map_swiss.go:458 - (reflect.flag).panicNotMap

5505: iter.go:108 - reflect.Seq$6
5506: value.go:2063 - (reflect.Value).Recv
   └─ Recv receives and returns a value from the channel v. It panics if v's Kind is not [Chan]. The receive blocks until a value is ready. The boolean value ok is true if the value x corresponds to a send on the channel, false if it is a zero value received because the channel is closed.
5507: value.go:2071 - (reflect.Value).recv

   └─ compare compares two values of the same type. It returns -1, 0, 1 according to whether a > b (1), a == b (0), or a < b (-1). If the types differ, it returns -1. See the comment on Sort for the comparison rules.
5656: sort.go:143 - fmtsort.nilCompare
   └─ nilCompare checks whether either value is nil. If not, the boolean is false. If either value is nil, the boolean is true and the integer is the comparison value. The comparison is defined to be 0 if both are nil, otherwise the one nil value compares low. Both arguments must represent a chan, func, interface, map, pointer, or slice.

5667: value.go:457 - reflectlite.arrayAt
   └─ arrayAt returns the i-th element of p, an array whose elements are eltSize bytes wide. The array pointed at by p must have at least i+1 elements: it is invalid (but impossible to check here) to pass i >= len, because then the result will point outside the array. whySafe must explain why i < len. (Passing "i < len" is fine; the benefit is to surface this assumption at the call site.)
5668: type.go:380 - reflectlite.add
   └─ add returns p+x. The whySafe string is ignored, so that the function still inlines as efficiently as p+x, but all call sites should use the string to record why the addition is safe, which is to say why the addition does not cause x to advance to the very end of p's allocation and therefore point incorrectly at the next block in memory.

5713: normalize.go:924 - tree.isVar
   └─ isVar returns true if the expression's value can vary during plan execution. The parameter allowConstPlaceholders should be true in the common case of scalar expressions that will be evaluated in the context of the execution of a prepared query, where the placeholder will have the same value for every row processed. It is set to false for scalar expressions that are not evaluated as part of query execution, eg. DEFAULT expressions.

   └─ MarshalJSON returns the JSON encoding of u.
6015: encode.go:205 - json.Marshal
   └─ Marshal returns the JSON encoding of v. Marshal traverses the value v recursively. If an encountered value implements [Marshaler] and is not a nil pointer, Marshal calls [Marshaler.MarshalJSON] to produce JSON. If no [Marshaler.MarshalJSON] method is present but the value implements [encoding.TextMarshaler] instead, Marshal calls [encoding.TextMarshaler.MarshalText] and encodes the result as a JSON string. The nil pointer exception is not strictly necessary but mimics a similar, necessary exception in the behavior of [Unmarshaler.UnmarshalJSON]. Otherwise, Marshal uses the following type-dependent default encodings: Boolean values encode as JSON booleans. Floating point, integer, and [Number] values encode as JSON numbers. NaN and +/-Inf values will return an [UnsupportedValueError]. String values encode as JSON strings coerced to valid UTF-8, replacing invalid bytes with the Unicode replacement rune. So that the JSON will be safe to embed inside HTML <script> tags, the string is encoded using [HTMLEscape], which replaces "<", ">", "&", U+2028, and U+2029 are escaped to "\u003c","\u003e", "\u0026", "\u2028", and "\u2029". This replacement can be disabled when using an [Encoder], by calling [Encoder.SetEscapeHTML](false). Array and slice values encode as JSON arrays, except that []byte encodes as a base64-encoded string, and a nil slice encodes as the null JSON value. Struct values encode as JSON objects. Each exported struct field becomes a member of the object, using the field name as the object key, unless the field is omitted for one of the reasons given below. The encoding of each struct field can be customized by the format string stored under the "json" key in the struct field's tag. The format string gives the name of the field, possibly followed by a comma-separated list of options. The name may be empty in order to specify options without overriding the default field name. The "omitempty" option specifies that the field should be omitted from the encoding if the field has an empty value, defined as false, 0, a nil pointer, a nil interface value, and any array, slice, map, or string of length zero. As a special case, if the field tag is "-", the field is always omitted. Note that a field with name "-" can still be generated using the tag "-,". Examples of struct field tags and their meanings: // Field appears in JSON as key "myName". Field int `json:"myName"` // Field appears in JSON as key "myName" and // the field is omitted from the object if its value is empty, // as defined above. Field int `json:"myName,omitempty"` // Field appears in JSON as key "Field" (the default), but // the field is skipped if empty. // Note the leading comma. Field int `json:",omitempty"` // Field is ignored by this package. Field int `json:"-"` // Field appears in JSON as key "-". Field int `json:"-,"` The "omitzero" option specifies that the field should be omitted from the encoding if the field has a zero value, according to rules: 1) If the field type has an "IsZero() bool" method, that will be used to determine whether the value is zero. 2) Otherwise, the value is zero if it is the zero value for its type. If both "omitempty" and "omitzero" are specified, the field will be omitted if the value is either empty or zero (or both). The "string" option signals that a field is stored as JSON inside a JSON-encoded string. It applies only to fields of string, floating point, integer, or boolean types. This extra level of encoding is sometimes used when communicating with JavaScript programs: Int64String int64 `json:",string"` The key name will be used if it's a non-empty string consisting of only Unicode letters, digits, and ASCII punctuation except quotation marks, backslash, and comma. Embedded struct fields are usually marshaled as if their inner exported fields were fields in the outer struct, subject to the usual Go visibility rules amended as described in the next paragraph. An anonymous struct field with a name given in its JSON tag is treated as having that name, rather than being anonymous. An anonymous struct field of interface type is treated the same as having that type as its name, rather than being anonymous. The Go visibility rules for struct fields are amended for JSON when deciding which field to marshal or unmarshal. If there are multiple fields at the same level, and that level is the least nested (and would therefore be the nesting level selected by the usual Go rules), the following extra rules apply: 1) Of those fields, if any are JSON-tagged, only tagged fields are considered, even if there are multiple untagged fields that would otherwise conflict. 2) If there is exactly one field (tagged or not according to the first rule), that is selected. 3) Otherwise there are multiple fields, and all are ignored; no error occurs. Handling of anonymous struct fields is new in Go 1.1. Prior to Go 1.1, anonymous struct fields were ignored. To force ignoring of an anonymous struct field in both current and earlier versions, give the field a JSON tag of "-". Map values encode as JSON objects. The map's key type must either be a string, an integer type, or implement [encoding.TextMarshaler]. The map keys are sorted and used as JSON object keys by applying the following rules, subject to the UTF-8 coercion described for string values above: - keys of any string type are used directly - keys that implement [encoding.TextMarshaler] are marshaled - integer keys are converted to strings Pointer values encode as the value pointed to. A nil pointer encodes as the null JSON value. Interface values encode as the value contained in the interface. A nil interface value encodes as the null JSON value. Channel, complex, and function values cannot be encoded in JSON. Attempting to encode such a value causes Marshal to return an [UnsupportedTypeError]. JSON cannot represent cyclic data structures and Marshal does not handle them. Passing cyclic structures to Marshal will result in an error.

6075: cpuprof.go:167 - (*runtime.cpuProfile).addExtra
   └─ addExtra adds the "extra" profiling events, queued by addNonGo, to the profile log. addExtra is called either from a signal handler on a Go thread or from an ordinary goroutine; either way it can use stack and has a g. The world may be stopped, though.
6076: profbuf.go:303 - (*runtime.profBuf).write [RECURSIVE]
   └─ write writes an entry to the profiling buffer b. The entry begins with a fixed hdr, which must have length b.hdrsize, followed by a variable-sized stack and a single tag pointer *tagPtr (or nil if tagPtr is nil). No write barriers allowed because this might be called from a signal handler.

Each record must be contiguous on its own, but the two records need not be contiguous (one can be at the end of the buffer and the other can wrap around and start at the beginning of the buffer).
6082: profbuf.go:141 - runtime.countSub
   └─ countSub subtracts two counts obtained from profIndex.dataCount or profIndex.tagCount, assuming that they are no more than 2^29 apart (guaranteed since they are never more than len(data) or len(tags) apart, respectively). tagCount wraps at 2^30, while dataCount wraps at 2^32. This function works for both.

6090: os_linux.go:581 - runtime.validSIGPROF
   └─ validSIGPROF compares this signal delivery's code against the signal sources that the profiler uses, returning whether the delivery should be processed. To be processed, a signal delivery from a known profiling mechanism should correspond to the best profiling mechanism available to this thread. Signals from other sources are always considered valid. go:nosplit

   └─ wantAsyncPreempt returns whether an asynchronous preemption is queued for gp.
6095: preempt.go:363 - runtime.isAsyncSafePoint
   └─ isAsyncSafePoint reports whether gp at instruction PC is an asynchronous safe point. This indicates that: 1. It's safe to suspend gp and conservatively scan its stack and registers. There are no potentially hidden pointer values and it's not in the middle of an atomic sequence like a write barrier. 2. gp has enough stack space to inject the asyncPreempt call. 3. It's generally safe to interact with the runtime, even if we're in a signal handler stopped here. For example, there are no runtime locks held, so acquiring a runtime lock won't self-deadlock. In some cases the PC is safe for asynchronous preemption but it also needs to adjust the resumption PC. The new PC is returned in the second result.

   └─ preparePanic sets up the stack to look like a call to sigpanic.
6105: panic.go:1500 - runtime.shouldPushSigpanic
   └─ shouldPushSigpanic reports whether pc should be used as sigpanic's return PC (pushing a frame for the call). Otherwise, it should be left alone so that LR is used as sigpanic's return PC, effectively replacing the top-most frame with sigpanic. This is used by preparePanic.
6106: sigqueue.go:71 - runtime.sigsend
   └─ sigsend delivers a signal from sighandler to the internal signal delivery queue. It reports whether the signal was sent. If not, the caller typically crashes the program. It runs from the signal handler, so it's limited in what it can do.

   └─ tracebacktrap is like traceback but expects that the PC and SP were obtained from a trap, not from gp->sched or gp->syscallpc/gp->syscallsp or GetCallerPC/GetCallerSP. Because they are from a trap instead of from a saved pair, the initial PC must not be rewound to the previous instruction. (All the saved pairs record a PC that is a return address, so we rewind it into the CALL instruction.) If gp.m.libcall{g,pc,sp} information is available, it uses that information in preference to the pc/sp/lr passed in.

Instead, it is the value obtained from the time.Unix function when passed the contents of the Timestamp, in the UTC locale. This may or may not be a meaningful time; many invalid Timestamps do map to valid time.Times. A nil Timestamp returns an error. The first return value in that case is undefined.

   └─ Sort accepts a map and returns a SortedMap that has the same keys and values but in a stable sorted order according to the keys, modulo issues raised by unorderable key values such as NaNs. The ordering rules are more general than with Go's < operator: - when applicable, nil compares low - ints, floats, and strings order by < - NaN compares less than non-NaN floats - bool compares false before true - complex compares real, then imag - pointers compare by machine address - channel values compare by machine address - structs compare each field in turn - arrays compare each element in turn. Otherwise identical arrays compare by length. - interface values compare first by reflect.Type describing the concrete type and then by concrete value as described in the previous rules.

However, we are not using the helper facilities from redact.SafePrinter to do this, so care should be taken below to properly escape markers, etc.
6299: format_error.go:293 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/errbase.state).formatSingleLineOutput
   └─ formatSingleLineOutput prints the details extracted via formatRecursive() through the chain of errors as if .Error() has been called: it only prints the non-detail parts and prints them on one line with ": " separators. This function is used both when FormatError() is called indirectly from .Error(), e.g. in: (e *myType) Error() { return fmt.Sprintf("%v", e) } (e *myType) Format(s fmt.State, verb rune) { errors.FormatError(s, verb, e) } and also to print the first line in the output of a %+v format. It reads from s.entries and writes to s.finalBuf. s.buf is left untouched. Note that if s.redactableOutput is true, s.finalBuf is to contain a RedactableBytes. However, we are not using the helper facilities from redact.SafePrinter to do this, so care should be taken below to properly escape markers, etc.
6300: markers.go:88 - redact.EscapeBytes
   └─ EscapeBytes escapes markers inside the given byte slice and encloses the entire byte slice between redaction markers.
6301: format_error.go:222 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/errbase.state).printEntry
   └─ printEntry renders the entry given as argument into s.finalBuf. If s.redactableOutput is set, then s.finalBuf is to contain a RedactableBytes, with redaction markers. In that case, we must be careful to escape (or not) the entry depending on entry.redactable. If s.redactableOutput is unset, then we are not caring about redactability. In that case entry.redactable is not set anyway and we can pass contents through.
6302: format_error.go:506 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/errors/errbase.state).finishDisplay
   └─ finishDisplay renders s.finalBuf into s.State.
6303: io.go:387 - io.Copy
   └─ Copy copies from src to dst until either EOF is reached on src or an error occurs. It returns the number of bytes copied and the first error encountered while copying, if any. A successful Copy returns err == nil, not err == EOF. Because Copy is defined to read from src until EOF, it does not treat an EOF from Read as an error to be reported. If src implements [WriterTo], the copy is implemented by calling src.WriteTo(dst). Otherwise, if dst implements [ReaderFrom], the copy is implemented by calling dst.ReadFrom(src).
6304: io.go:407 - io.copyBuffer
   └─ copyBuffer is the actual implementation of Copy and CopyBuffer. if buf is nil, one is allocated.

   └─ RawRead invokes the user-defined function f for a read operation.
6313: zero_copy_posix.go:16 - os.wrapSyscallError
   └─ wrapSyscallError takes an error and a syscall name. If the error is a syscall.Errno, it wraps it in an os.SyscallError using the syscall name.
6314: error.go:67 - os.NewSyscallError
   └─ NewSyscallError returns, as an error, a new [SyscallError] with the given system call name and error details. As a convenience, if err is nil, NewSyscallError returns nil.

   └─ WriteTo writes data to w until the buffer is drained or an error occurs. The return value n is the number of bytes written; it always fits into an int, but it is int64 to match the [io.WriterTo] interface. Any error encountered during the write is also returned.
6317: reader.go:137 - (*strings.Reader).WriteTo
   └─ WriteTo implements the [io.WriterTo] interface.
6318: reader.go:137 - (*bytes.Reader).WriteTo
   └─ WriteTo implements the [io.WriterTo] interface.
6319: file.go:282 - (os.noWriteTo).WriteTo
   └─ WriteTo hides another WriteTo method. It should never be called.
6320: buffer.go:212 - (*bytes.Buffer).ReadFrom
   └─ ReadFrom reads data from r until EOF and appends it to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed. The return value n is the number of bytes read. Any error except io.EOF encountered during the read is also returned. If the buffer becomes too large, ReadFrom will panic with [ErrTooLarge].
6321: file.go:175 - (*os.File).ReadFrom
   └─ ReadFrom implements io.ReaderFrom.

6323: zero_copy_linux.go:89 - (*os.File).copyFileRange
6324: zero_copy_posix.go:26 - os.tryLimitedReader
   └─ tryLimitedReader tries to assert the io.Reader to io.LimitedReader, it returns the io.LimitedReader, the underlying io.Reader and the remaining amount of bytes if the assertion succeeds, otherwise it just returns the original io.Reader and the theoretical unlimited remaining amount of bytes.
6325: zero_copy_linux.go:59 - (*os.File).spliceToFile
6326: file.go:204 - os.genericReadFrom
6327: file.go:192 - (os.noReadFrom).ReadFrom
   └─ ReadFrom hides another ReadFrom method. It should never be called.
6328: bufio.go:787 - (*bufio.Writer).ReadFrom [RECURSIVE]
   └─ ReadFrom implements [io.ReaderFrom]. If the underlying writer supports the ReadFrom method, this calls the underlying ReadFrom. If there is buffered data and an underlying ReadFrom, this fills the buffer and writes it before calling ReadFrom.
6329: formatter.go:29 - pretty.Formatter
   └─ Formatter makes a wrapper, f, that will format x as go source with line breaks and tabs. Object f responds to the "%v" formatting verb when both the "#" and " " (space) flags are set, for example: fmt.Sprintf("%# v", Formatter(x)) If one of these two flags is not set, or any other verb is used, f will format x according to the usual rules of package fmt. In particular, if x satisfies fmt.Formatter, then x.Format will be called.
6330: format.go:359 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.fmt).fmtS
   └─ fmtS formats a string.
6331: format.go:326 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.fmt).truncateString

6333: format.go:449 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.fmt).fmtQ
   └─ fmtQ formats a string as a double-quoted, escaped Go string constant. If f.sharp is set a raw (backquoted) string may be returned instead if the string does not contain any control characters other than tab.
6334: quote.go:144 - strconv.AppendQuoteToASCII
   └─ AppendQuoteToASCII appends a double-quoted Go string literal representing s, as generated by [QuoteToASCII], to dst and returns the extended buffer.
6335: format.go:92 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.fmt).pad
   └─ pad appends b to f.buf, padded on left (!f.minus) or right (f.minus).

   └─ fmtSbx formats a string or byte slice as a hexadecimal encoding of its bytes.
6339: time.go:943 - (time.Duration).String
   └─ String returns a string representing the duration in the form "72h3m0.5s". Leading zero units are omitted. As a special case, durations less than one second format use a smaller unit (milli-, micro-, or nanoseconds) to ensure that the leading digit is non-zero. The zero duration formats as 0s.
6340: time.go:953 - (time.Duration).format
   └─ format formats the representation of d into the end of buf and returns the offset of the first character.
6341: time.go:1030 - time.fmtFrac
   └─ fmtFrac formats the fraction of v/10**prec (e.g., ".12345") into the tail of buf, omitting trailing zeros. It omits the decimal point too when the fraction is 0. It returns the index where the output bytes begin and the value v/10**prec.
6342: type.go:959 - (reflect.ChanDir).String
6343: binary.go:148 - (encoding/binary.littleEndian).String
6344: zoneinfo.go:103 - (*time.Location).String

6346: fs.go:202 - (io/fs.FileMode).String
6347: format.go:546 - (time.Time).String
   └─ String returns the time formatted using the format string "2006-01-02 15:04:05.999999999 -0700 MST" If the time has a monotonic clock reading, the returned string includes a final field "m=±<value>", where value is the monotonic clock reading formatted as a decimal number of seconds. The returned string is meant for debugging; for a stable serialized representation, use t.MarshalText, t.MarshalBinary, or t.Format with an explicit format string.
6348: tracking_reader_detailed.go:37 - (github.com/mattdurham/blockpack/internal/blockio.IOCategory).String
6349: help.go:42 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/parser.HelpMessage).String
   └─ String implements the fmt.String interface.
6350: help.go:50 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/parser.HelpMessage).Format
   └─ Format prints out details about the message onto the specified output stream.
6351: print.go:302 - fmt.Fprintln
   └─ Fprintln formats using the default formats for its operands and writes to w. Spaces are always added between operands and a newline is appended. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error encountered.

   └─ Text is the same as Marshal, but returns the string directly.
6357: text.go:863 - (*github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto.TextMarshaler).Marshal
   └─ Marshal writes a given protocol buffer in text format. The only errors returned are from w.
6358: bufio.go:610 - bufio.NewWriter
   └─ NewWriter returns a new [Writer] whose buffer has the default size. If the argument io.Writer is already a [Writer] with large enough buffer size, it returns the underlying [Writer].
6359: bufio.go:592 - bufio.NewWriterSize
   └─ NewWriterSize returns a new [Writer] whose buffer has at least the specified size. If the argument io.Writer is already a [Writer] with large enough size, it returns the underlying [Writer].

6361: text.go:214 - (*github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto.TextMarshaler).writeProto3Any
   └─ writeProto3Any writes an expanded google.protobuf.Any message. It returns (false, nil) if sv value can't be unmarshaled (e.g. because required messages are not linked in). It returns (true, error) when sv was written in expanded format or an error was encountered.
6362: properties.go:591 - proto.MessageType
   └─ MessageType returns the message type (pointer to struct) for a named message. The type is not guaranteed to implement proto.Message if the name refers to a map entry.
6363: text.go:179 - proto.requiresQuotes
6364: text.go:631 - proto.writeString
   └─ writeString writes a string in the protocol buffer text format. It is similar to strconv.Quote except we don't use Go escape sequences, we treat the string as a byte sequence, and we use octal escapes. These differences are to maintain interoperability with the other languages' implementations of the text format.
6365: text.go:622 - proto.isprint
   └─ equivalent to C's isprint.
6366: text.go:199 - proto.isAny

   └─ writeAny writes an arbitrary field.
6380: text.go:751 - (*github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto.TextMarshaler).writeExtensions
   └─ writeExtensions writes all the extensions in pv. pv is assumed to be a pointer to a protocol message struct that is extendable.
6381: extensions.go:345 - proto.GetExtension
   └─ GetExtension retrieves a proto2 extended field from pb. If the descriptor is type complete (i.e., ExtensionDesc.ExtensionType is non-nil), then GetExtension parses the encoded field and returns a Go value of the specified type. If the field is not present, then the default value is returned (if one is specified), otherwise ErrMissingExtension is reported. If the descriptor is not type complete (i.e., ExtensionDesc.ExtensionType is nil), then GetExtension returns the raw encoded bytes of the field extension.
6382: extensions_gogo.go:283 - proto.decodeExtensionFromBytes
6383: extensions.go:408 - proto.defaultExtensionValue
   └─ defaultExtensionValue returns the default value for extension. If no default for an extension is defined ErrMissingExtension is returned.

   └─ Init populates the properties from a protocol buffer struct tag.
6386: lib.go:800 - proto.fieldDefault
   └─ fieldDefault returns the scalarField for field type ft. sf will be nil if the field can not have a default. nestedMessage will be true if this is a nested message. Note that sf.index is not set on return.
6387: atob.go:10 - strconv.ParseBool
   └─ ParseBool returns the boolean value represented by the string. It accepts 1, t, T, TRUE, true, True, 0, f, F, FALSE, false, False. Any other value returns an error.

   └─ fmtUnicode formats a uint64 as "U+0078" or with f.sharp set as "U+0078 'x'".
6640: format.go:477 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.fmt).fmtQc
   └─ fmtQc formats an integer as a single-quoted, escaped Go character constant. If the character is not valid Unicode, it will print '\ufffd'.
6641: quote.go:189 - strconv.AppendQuoteRuneToASCII
   └─ AppendQuoteRuneToASCII appends a single-quoted Go character literal representing the rune, as generated by [QuoteRuneToASCII], to dst and returns the extended buffer.
6642: quote.go:58 - strconv.appendQuotedRuneWith
6643: quote.go:173 - strconv.AppendQuoteRune
   └─ AppendQuoteRune appends a single-quoted Go character literal representing the rune, as generated by [QuoteRune], to dst and returns the extended buffer.
6644: print.go:417 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.pp).fmtFloat
   └─ fmtFloat formats a float. The default precision for each verb is specified as last argument in the call to fmt_float.
6645: format.go:492 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.fmt).fmtFloat
   └─ fmtFloat formats a float64. It assumes that verb is a valid format specifier for strconv.AppendFloat and therefore fits into a byte.
6646: ftoa.go:55 - strconv.AppendFloat
   └─ AppendFloat appends the string form of the floating-point number f, as generated by [FormatFloat], to dst and returns the extended buffer.
6647: print.go:435 - (*github.com/cockroachdb/redact/internal.pp).fmtComplex
   └─ fmtComplex formats a complex number v with r = real(v) and j = imag(v) as (r+ji) using fmtFloat for r and j formatting.
6648: sort.go:54 - fmtsort.Sort
   └─ Sort accepts a map and returns a SortedMap that has the same keys and values but in a stable sorted order according to the keys, modulo issues raised by unorderable key values such as NaNs. The ordering rules are more general than with Go's < operator: - when applicable, nil compares low - ints, floats, and strings order by < - NaN compares less than non-NaN floats - bool compares false before true - complex compares real, then imag - pointers compare by machine address - channel values compare by machine address - structs compare each field in turn - arrays compare each element in turn. Otherwise identical arrays compare by length. - interface values compare first by reflect.Type describing the concrete type and then by concrete value as described in the previous rules.
6649: print.go:302 - fmt.getField
   └─ getField gets the i'th field of the struct value. If the field is itself is an interface, return a value for the thing inside the interface, not the interface itself.

6657: hooks.go:80 - fmt.CollectingError
   └─ CollectingError exposes wrapped error collection.
6658: markers_internal_print.go:115 - redact.annotateArg
   └─ annotateArg wraps the arguments to one of the print functions with an indirect formatter which ensures that redaction markers inside the representation of the object are escaped, and optionally encloses the result of the display between redaction markers. collectingError is true iff we are in the context of HelperForErrorf, where we want the %w verb to work properly. This adds a little overhead to the processing, but this is OK because typically the error path is not perf-critical.
6659: wrappers.go:61 - (github.com/cockroachdb/redact.safeWrapper).SafeMessage

6665: mprof.go:1301 - (*runtime.goroutineProfileStateHolder).CompareAndSwap
6666: mprof.go:1470 - runtime.doRecordGoroutineProfile
   └─ doRecordGoroutineProfile writes gp1's call stack and labels to an in-progress goroutine profile. Preemption is disabled. This may be called via tryRecordGoroutineProfile in two ways: by the goroutine that is coordinating the goroutine profile (running on its own stack), or from the scheduler in preparation to execute gp1 (running on the system stack).

6672: proc.go:3363 - runtime.findRunnable
   └─ Finds a runnable goroutine to execute. Tries to steal from other P's, get g from local or global queue, poll network. tryWakeP indicates that the returned goroutine is not normal (GC worker, trace reader) so the caller should try to wake a P.
6673: proc.go:1080 - (*runtime.m).clearAllpSnapshot
   └─ Clear the saved allp snapshot. Should be called as soon as the snapshot is no longer required. Must be called after reacquiring a P, as it requires a write barrier. go:yeswritebarrierrec
6674: proc.go:3287 - runtime.gcstopm
   └─ Stops the current m for stopTheWorld. Returns when the world is restarted.
6675: time.go:1006 - (*runtime.timers).check
   └─ check runs any timers in ts that are ready. If now is not 0 it is the current time. It returns the passed time or the current time if now was passed as 0. and the time when the next timer should run or 0 if there is no next timer, and reports whether it ran any timers. If the time when the next timer should run is not 0, it is always larger than the returned time. We pass now in and out to avoid extra calls of nanotime. go:yeswritebarrierrec
6676: time.go:182 - (*runtime.timers).lock
6677: time.go:858 - (*runtime.timers).adjust
   └─ adjust looks through the timers in ts.heap for any timers that have been modified to run earlier, and puts them in the correct place in the heap. While looking for those timers, it also moves timers that have been modified to run later, and removes deleted timers. The caller must have locked ts.
6678: time.go:1270 - (*runtime.timers).verify
   └─ verifyTimerHeap verifies that the timers is in a valid state. This is only for debugging, and is only called if verifyTimers is true. The caller must have locked ts.
6679: time.go:254 - (*runtime.timer).lock
   └─ lock locks the timer, allowing reading or writing any of the timer fields.
6680: time.go:225 - (*runtime.timer).trace
6681: time.go:231 - (*runtime.timer).trace1
6682: time.go:260 - (*runtime.timer).unlock
   └─ unlock updates t.astate and unlocks the timer.
6683: time.go:1415 - (*runtime.timers).initHeap
   └─ initHeap reestablishes the heap order in the slice ts.heap. It takes O(n) time for n=len(ts.heap), not the O(n log n) of n repeated add operations.
6684: time.go:1376 - (*runtime.timers).siftDown
   └─ siftDown puts the timer at position i in the right place in the heap by moving it down toward the bottom of the heap.
6685: time.go:186 - (*runtime.timers).unlock
6686: time.go:1071 - (*runtime.timers).run
   └─ run examines the first timer in ts. If it is ready based on now, it runs the timer and removes or updates it. Returns 0 if it ran a timer, -1 if there are no more timers, or the time when the first timer should run. The caller must have locked ts. If a timer is run, this will temporarily unlock ts. go:systemstack
6687: time.go:287 - (*runtime.timer).updateHeap
   └─ updateHeap updates t as directed by t.state, updating t.state and returning a bool indicating whether the state (and ts.heap[0].when) changed. The caller must hold t's lock, or the world can be stopped instead. The timer set t.ts must be non-nil and locked, t must be t.ts.heap[0], and updateHeap takes care of moving t within the timers heap to preserve the heap invariants. If ts == nil, then t must not be in a heap (or is in a heap that is temporarily not maintaining its invariant, such as during timers.adjust).
6688: time.go:545 - (*runtime.timers).deleteMin
   └─ deleteMin removes timer 0 from ts. ts must be locked.
6689: time.go:1116 - (*runtime.timer).unlockAndRun
   └─ unlockAndRun unlocks and runs the timer t (which must be locked). If t is in a timer set (t.ts != nil), the caller must also have locked the timer set, and this call will temporarily unlock the timer set while running the timer function. unlockAndRun returns with t unlocked and t.ts (re-)locked. go:systemstack
6690: race0.go:42 - runtime.racegostart
6691: race0.go:32 - runtime.raceacquirectx
6692: trace.go:947 - runtime.traceReader
   └─ traceReader returns the trace reader that should be woken up, if any. Callers should first check (traceEnabled() || traceShuttingDown()). This must run on the system stack because it acquires trace.lock. go:systemstack
6693: mgcpacer.go:754 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).findRunnableGCWorker
   └─ findRunnableGCWorker returns a background mark worker for pp if it should be run. This must only be called when gcBlackenEnabled != 0.
6694: mgclimit.go:144 - (*runtime.gcCPULimiterState).needUpdate
   └─ needUpdate returns true if the limiter's maximum update period has been exceeded, and so would benefit from an update.
6695: mgcpacer.go:806 - runtime.findRunnableGCWorker$1
6696: proc.go:6873 - runtime.globrunqget
   └─ Try get a single G from the global runnable queue. sched.lock must be held.
6697: mfinal.go:162 - runtime.wakefing
6698: mcleanup.go:505 - (*runtime.cleanupQueue).needsWake
   └─ needsWake returns true if cleanup goroutines may need to be awoken or created to handle cleanup load.
6699: mcleanup.go:624 - runtime.maxCleanupGs
6700: mcleanup.go:512 - (*runtime.cleanupQueue).wake
   └─ wake wakes up one or more goroutines to process the cleanup queue. If there aren't enough sleeping goroutines to handle the demand, wake will arrange for new goroutines to be created.
6701: proc.go:7164 - runtime.runqget
   └─ Get g from local runnable queue. If inheritTime is true, gp should inherit the remaining time in the current time slice. Otherwise, it should start a new time slice. Executed only by the owner P.
6702: proc.go:6885 - runtime.globrunqgetbatch
   └─ Try get a batch of G's from the global runnable queue. sched.lock must be held.
6703: types.go:44 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Int32).Swap
   └─ Swap replaces i's value with new, returning i's value before the replacement. go:nosplit
6704: stubs.go:56 - atomic.Xchgint32
   └─ go:noescape
6705: proc.go:1056 - (*runtime.m).becomeSpinning
6706: proc.go:3802 - runtime.stealWork
   └─ stealWork attempts to steal a runnable goroutine or timer from any P. If newWork is true, new work may have been readied. If now is not 0 it is the current time. stealWork returns the passed time or the current time if now was passed as 0.
6707: proc.go:7574 - (*runtime.randomOrder).start
6708: proc.go:7582 - (*runtime.randomEnum).done

6710: proc.go:7591 - (*runtime.randomEnum).position
6711: proc.go:6908 - (runtime.pMask).read
   └─ read returns true if P id's bit is set.
6712: proc.go:7283 - runtime.runqsteal
   └─ Steal half of elements from local runnable queue of p2 and put onto local runnable queue of p. Returns one of the stolen elements (or nil if failed).
6713: proc.go:7228 - runtime.runqgrab
   └─ Grabs a batch of goroutines from pp's runnable queue into batch. Batch is a ring buffer starting at batchHead. Returns number of grabbed goroutines. Can be executed by any P.
6714: lock_futex.go:129 - runtime.beforeIdle
6715: mgcpacer.go:1380 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).addIdleMarkWorker
   └─ addIdleMarkWorker attempts to add a new idle mark worker. If this returns true, the caller must become an idle mark worker unless there's no background mark worker goroutines in the pool. This case is harmless because there are already background mark workers running. If this returns false, the caller must NOT become an idle mark worker. nosplit because it may be called without a P. go:nosplit
6716: proc.go:1069 - (*runtime.m).snapshotAllp
   └─ Take a snapshot of allp, for use after dropping the P. Must be called with a P, but the returned slice may be used after dropping the P. The M holds a reference on the snapshot to keep the backing array alive. go:yeswritebarrierrec
6717: proc.go:3876 - runtime.checkRunqsNoP
   └─ Check all Ps for a runnable G to steal. On entry we have no P. If a G is available to steal and a P is available, the P is returned which the caller should acquire and attempt to steal the work to.
6718: proc.go:3915 - runtime.checkIdleGCNoP
   └─ Check for idle-priority GC, without a P on entry. If some GC work, a P, and a worker G are all available, the P and G will be returned. The returned P has not been wired yet.
6719: proc.go:3898 - runtime.checkTimersNoP
   └─ Check all Ps for a timer expiring sooner than pollUntil. Returns updated pollUntil value.
6720: types.go:97 - (*internal/runtime/atomic.Int64).Swap
   └─ Swap replaces i's value with new, returning i's value before the replacement. go:nosplit
6721: stubs.go:59 - atomic.Xchgint64
   └─ go:noescape
6722: proc.go:3995 - runtime.resetspinning
6723: proc.go:3269 - runtime.startlockedm
   └─ Schedules the locked m to run the locked gp. May run during STW, so write barriers are not allowed. go:nowritebarrierrec
6724: mgcpacer.go:386 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).startCycle
   └─ startCycle resets the GC controller's state and computes estimates for a new GC cycle. The caller must hold worldsema and the world must be stopped.
6725: mgcpacer.go:1435 - (*runtime.gcControllerState).setMaxIdleMarkWorkers
   └─ setMaxIdleMarkWorkers sets the maximum number of idle mark workers allowed. This method is optimistic in that it does not wait for the number of idle mark workers to reduce to max before returning; it assumes the workers will deschedule themselves.
6726: mgc.go:1393 - runtime.gcBgMarkPrepare
   └─ gcBgMarkPrepare sets up state for background marking. Mutator assists must not yet be enabled.
6727: mgcmark.go:1799 - runtime.gcMarkTinyAllocs
   └─ gcMarkTinyAllocs greys all active tiny alloc blocks. The world must be stopped.
6728: malloc.go:1724 - runtime.memclrNoHeapPointersChunked
   └─ memclrNoHeapPointersChunked repeatedly calls memclrNoHeapPointers on chunks of the buffer to be zeroed, with opportunities for preemption along the way.  memclrNoHeapPointers contains no safepoints and also cannot be preemptively scheduled, so this provides a still-efficient block copy that can also be preempted on a reasonable granularity. Use this with care; if the data being cleared is tagged to contain pointers, this allows the GC to run before it is all cleared.
6729: proc.go:396 - runtime.goschedguarded
   └─ goschedguarded yields the processor like gosched, but also checks for forbidden states and opts out of the yield in those cases. go:nosplit
6730: mbitmap.go:724 - runtime.heapSetTypeLarge
6731: mbitmap.go:782 - runtime.doubleCheckHeapType

6734: mbitmap.go:868 - runtime.doubleCheckHeapPointersInterior
6735: mbitmap.go:118 - (*runtime.mspan).typePointersOf
   └─ typePointersOf returns an iterator over all heap pointers in the range [addr, addr+size). addr and addr+size must be in the range [span.base(), span.limit). Note: addr+size must be passed as the limit argument to the iterator's next method on each iteration. This slightly awkward API is to allow typePointers to be destructured by the compiler. nosplit because it is used during write barriers and must not be preempted. go:nosplit
6736: malloc.go:1110 - runtime.mallocgcTiny
6737: malloc.go:931 - runtime.nextFreeFast
   └─ nextFreeFast returns the next free object if one is quickly available. Otherwise it returns 0.
6738: malloc.go:958 - (*runtime.mcache).nextFree
   └─ nextFree returns the next free object from the cached span if one is available. Otherwise it refills the cache with a span with an available object and returns that object along with a flag indicating that this was a heavy weight allocation. If it is a heavy weight allocation the caller must determine whether a new GC cycle needs to be started or if the GC is active whether this goroutine needs to assist the GC. Must run in a non-preemptible context since otherwise the owner of c could change.
6739: mbitmap.go:1093 - (*runtime.mspan).nextFreeIndex
   └─ nextFreeIndex returns the index of the next free object in s at or after s.freeindex. There are hardware instructions that can be used to make this faster if profiling warrants it.
6740: mcache.go:149 - (*runtime.mcache).refill
   └─ refill acquires a new span of span class spc for c. This span will have at least one free object. The current span in c must be full. Must run in a non-preemptible context since otherwise the owner of c could change.
6741: mcentral.go:82 - (*runtime.mcentral).cacheSpan
   └─ Allocate a span to use in an mcache.
6742: mcentral.go:251 - (*runtime.mcentral).grow
   └─ grow allocates a new empty span from the heap and initializes it for c's size class.

6745: mbitmap.go:705 - runtime.heapSetTypeNoHeader
6746: mbitmap.go:624 - (*runtime.mspan).writeHeapBitsSmall
   └─ writeHeapBitsSmall writes the heap bits for small objects whose ptr/scalar data is stored as a bitmap at the end of the span. Assumes dataSize is <= ptrBits*goarch.PtrSize. x must be a pointer into the span. heapBitsInSpan(dataSize) must be true. dataSize must be >= typ.Size_. go:nosplit

6748: mbitmap.go:716 - runtime.heapSetTypeSmallHeader
6749: malloc.go:1668 - runtime.postMallocgcDebug
6750: traceallocfree.go:122 - (runtime.traceLocker).HeapObjectAlloc
   └─ HeapObjectAlloc records that an object was newly allocated at addr with the provided type. The type is optional, and the size of the slot occupied the object is inferred from the span containing it.
6751: traceevent.go:90 - (runtime.traceLocker).rtype
   └─ rtype returns a traceArg representing typ which may be passed to write.
6752: tracetype.go:26 - (*runtime.traceTypeTable).put
   └─ put returns a unique id for the type typ and caches it in the table, if it's seeing it for the first time. N.B. typ must be kept alive forever for this to work correctly.
6753: mheap.go:2390 - runtime.setTinyBlockContext
   └─ setTinyBlockContext marks an allocation as a tiny block to diagnostics like checkfinalizer. A tiny block is only marked if it actually contains more than one distinct value, since we're using this for debugging.
6754: format.go:360 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtS
   └─ fmtS formats a string.
6755: format.go:327 - (*fmt.fmt).truncateString
   └─ truncateString truncates the string s to the specified precision, if present.
6756: print.go:488 - (*fmt.pp).fmtString
6757: format.go:450 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtQ
   └─ fmtQ formats a string as a double-quoted, escaped Go string constant. If f.sharp is set a raw (backquoted) string may be returned instead if the string does not contain any control characters other than tab.
6758: format.go:93 - (*fmt.fmt).pad
   └─ pad appends b to f.buf, padded on left (!f.minus) or right (f.minus).
6759: format.go:438 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtSx
   └─ fmtSx formats a string as a hexadecimal encoding of its bytes.
6760: format.go:372 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtSbx
   └─ fmtSbx formats a string or byte slice as a hexadecimal encoding of its bytes.
6761: print.go:402 - (*fmt.pp).fmtBool
6762: format.go:129 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtBoolean
   └─ fmtBoolean formats a boolean.
6763: print.go:421 - (*fmt.pp).fmtInteger
   └─ fmtInteger formats a signed or unsigned integer.
6764: format.go:197 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtInteger
   └─ fmtInteger formats signed and unsigned integers.
6765: print.go:413 - (*fmt.pp).fmt0x64
   └─ fmt0x64 formats a uint64 in hexadecimal and prefixes it with 0x or not, as requested, by temporarily setting the sharp flag.
6766: format.go:466 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtC
   └─ fmtC formats an integer as a Unicode character. If the character is not valid Unicode, it will print '\ufffd'.
6767: format.go:479 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtQc
   └─ fmtQc formats an integer as a single-quoted, escaped Go character constant. If the character is not valid Unicode, it will print '\ufffd'.
6768: format.go:138 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtUnicode
   └─ fmtUnicode formats a uint64 as "U+0078" or with f.sharp set as "U+0078 'x'".
6769: print.go:452 - (*fmt.pp).fmtFloat
   └─ fmtFloat formats a float. The default precision for each verb is specified as last argument in the call to fmt_float.
6770: format.go:494 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtFloat
   └─ fmtFloat formats a float64. It assumes that verb is a valid format specifier for strconv.AppendFloat and therefore fits into a byte.
6771: print.go:470 - (*fmt.pp).fmtComplex
   └─ fmtComplex formats a complex number v with r = real(v) and j = imag(v) as (r+ji) using fmtFloat for r and j formatting.
6772: sort.go:49 - fmtsort.Sort
   └─ Sort accepts a map and returns a SortedMap that has the same keys and values but in a stable sorted order according to the keys, modulo issues raised by unorderable key values such as NaNs. The ordering rules are more general than with Go's < operator: - when applicable, nil compares low - ints, floats, and strings order by < - NaN compares less than non-NaN floats - bool compares false before true - complex compares real, then imag - pointers compare by machine address - channel values compare by machine address - structs compare each field in turn - arrays compare each element in turn. Otherwise identical arrays compare by length. - interface values compare first by reflect.Type describing the concrete type and then by concrete value as described in the previous rules.
6773: print.go:341 - fmt.getField
   └─ getField gets the i'th field of the struct value. If the field itself is a non-nil interface, return a value for the thing inside the interface, not the interface itself.
6774: print.go:509 - (*fmt.pp).fmtBytes
6775: format.go:366 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtBs
   └─ fmtBs formats the byte slice b as if it was formatted as string with fmtS.
6776: format.go:341 - (*fmt.fmt).truncate
   └─ truncate truncates the byte slice b as a string of the specified precision, if present.
6777: format.go:443 - (*fmt.fmt).fmtBx
   └─ fmtBx formats a byte slice as a hexadecimal encoding of its bytes.

   └─ ReadAt reads from the underlying file. Does NOT implement Slice to force realistic IO operations for benchmarks.
6785: file.go:152 - (*os.File).ReadAt
   └─ ReadAt reads len(b) bytes from the File starting at byte offset off. It returns the number of bytes read and the error, if any. ReadAt always returns a non-nil error when n < len(b). At end of file, that error is io.EOF.
6786: file_posix.go:37 - (*os.File).pread
   └─ pread reads len(b) bytes from the File starting at byte offset off. It returns the number of bytes read and the error, if any. EOF is signaled by a zero count with err set to nil.
6787: fd_unix.go:176 - (*internal/poll.FD).Pread
   └─ Pread wraps the pread system call.
6788: fd_mutex.go:201 - (*internal/poll.FD).incref

   └─ NewReaderFromProvider creates a reader from a ReaderProvider.
6812: api.go:80 - blockpack.ExecuteTraceQL
   └─ ExecuteTraceQL executes a TraceQL query against the provided storage. This is the primary query interface - it accepts a TraceQL string and returns results. The path parameter specifies the blockpack file to query. For structural queries (using >>, >, ~, <<, <, !~ operators), use ExecuteTraceQLStructural.
6813: parser.go:14 - traceqlparser.ParseTraceQL
   └─ ParseTraceQL parses a TraceQL query and returns an AST Supports basic filter syntax: { <expression> } Also supports metrics queries: { filter } | aggregate() by (fields) Also supports structural queries: { expr } OP { expr } where OP is >>, >, ~, <<, <, !~

6830: strings.go:333 - strings.SplitN
   └─ SplitN slices s into substrings separated by sep and returns a slice of the substrings between those separators. The count determines the number of substrings to return: - n > 0: at most n substrings; the last substring will be the unsplit remainder; - n == 0: the result is nil (zero substrings); - n < 0: all substrings. Edge cases for s and sep (for example, empty strings) are handled as described in the documentation for [Split]. To split around the first instance of a separator, see [Cut].

   └─ NewBlockpackExecutor constructs an executor backed by FileStorage.
6843: traceql_structural.go:38 - executor.ExecuteTraceQLStructural
   └─ ExecuteTraceQLStructural is the top-level API for executing structural TraceQL queries. It integrates the parser, compiler, and executor into a single function call. Workflow: 1. Parse TraceQL string → AST (traceqlparser.StructuralQuery) 2. Compile AST → StructuralQueryPlan (LHS/RHS programs + operator) 3. Execute plan → BlockpackResult (filtered spans based on relationships) Example: executor := NewBlockpackExecutor(storage) result, err := ExecuteTraceQLStructural( executor, path, "{ .root = true } >> { .leaf = true }", QueryOptions{Limit: 100}, ) Supported operators: - >> : descendant (all descendants in tree) - >  : child (direct children only) - ~  : sibling (shares same parent) - << : ancestor (all ancestors in tree) - <  : parent (direct parent only) - !~ : not sibling (negated sibling) Returns: - BlockpackResult with spans matching the structural relationship - Error if parsing, compilation, or execution fails
6844: traceql_compile.go:290 - sql.CompileTraceQLStructural
   └─ CompileTraceQLStructural compiles a TraceQL structural query string to a StructuralQueryPlan. Structural query syntax: { filter1 } <op> { filter2 } Operators: >> (descendant), > (child), ~ (sibling), << (ancestor), < (parent), !~ (not sibling) Example: { .root = true } >> { .leaf = true } Returns a StructuralQueryPlan that can be executed with executor.ExecuteStructuralQuery()

   └─ filterMatch checks if two FilterSpecs are equivalent.
6871: deepequal.go:229 - reflect.DeepEqual
   └─ DeepEqual reports whether x and y are “deeply equal,” defined as follows. Two values of identical type are deeply equal if one of the following cases applies. Values of distinct types are never deeply equal. Array values are deeply equal when their corresponding elements are deeply equal. Struct values are deeply equal if their corresponding fields, both exported and unexported, are deeply equal. Func values are deeply equal if both are nil; otherwise they are not deeply equal. Interface values are deeply equal if they hold deeply equal concrete values. Map values are deeply equal when all of the following are true: they are both nil or both non-nil, they have the same length, and either they are the same map object or their corresponding keys (matched using Go equality) map to deeply equal values. Pointer values are deeply equal if they are equal using Go's == operator or if they point to deeply equal values. Slice values are deeply equal when all of the following are true: they are both nil or both non-nil, they have the same length, and either they point to the same initial entry of the same underlying array (that is, &x[0] == &y[0]) or their corresponding elements (up to length) are deeply equal. Note that a non-nil empty slice and a nil slice (for example, []byte{} and []byte(nil)) are not deeply equal. Other values - numbers, bools, strings, and channels - are deeply equal if they are equal using Go's == operator. In general DeepEqual is a recursive relaxation of Go's == operator. However, this idea is impossible to implement without some inconsistency. Specifically, it is possible for a value to be unequal to itself, either because it is of func type (uncomparable in general) or because it is a floating-point NaN value (not equal to itself in floating-point comparison), or because it is an array, struct, or interface containing such a value. On the other hand, pointer values are always equal to themselves, even if they point at or contain such problematic values, because they compare equal using Go's == operator, and that is a sufficient condition to be deeply equal, regardless of content. DeepEqual has been defined so that the same short-cut applies to slices and maps: if x and y are the same slice or the same map, they are deeply equal regardless of content. As DeepEqual traverses the data values it may find a cycle. The second and subsequent times that DeepEqual compares two pointer values that have been compared before, it treats the values as equal rather than examining the values to which they point. This ensures that DeepEqual terminates.
6872: deepequal.go:27 - reflect.deepValueEqual [RECURSIVE]
   └─ Tests for deep equality using reflected types. The map argument tracks comparisons that have already been seen, which allows short circuiting on recursive types.

6878: blockpack_executor.go:2999 - (*github.com/mattdurham/blockpack/internal/executor.BlockpackExecutor).readPrecomputedMetricStreams
   └─ readPrecomputedMetricStreams reads pre-computed metric stream results from a metric stream. This is the fast path for queries that match pre-computed metric streams. Implementation will be added in Phase 6 when Writer support is complete.
6879: folder_storage.go:69 - (*github.com/mattdurham/blockpack/internal/executor.FolderStorage).GetProvider
   └─ GetProvider returns a reader provider for the requested path.
6880: folder_storage.go:24 - (*github.com/mattdurham/blockpack/internal/executor.FolderStorage).safePath
   └─ safePath validates that the given path is safe and within the base directory. It prevents path traversal attacks by ensuring the resolved path doesn't escape baseDir.
6881: path.go:55 - filepath.Clean
   └─ Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path by purely lexical processing. It applies the following rules iteratively until no further processing can be done: 1. Replace multiple [Separator] elements with a single one. 2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory). 3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory) along with the non-.. element that precedes it. 4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path: that is, replace "/.." by "/" at the beginning of a path, assuming Separator is '/'. The returned path ends in a slash only if it represents a root directory, such as "/" on Unix or `C:\` on Windows. Finally, any occurrences of slash are replaced by Separator. If the result of this process is an empty string, Clean returns the string ".". On Windows, Clean does not modify the volume name other than to replace occurrences of "/" with `\`. For example, Clean("//host/share/../x") returns `\\host\share\x`. See also Rob Pike, “Lexical File Names in Plan 9 or Getting Dot-Dot Right,” https://9p.io/sys/doc/lexnames.html
6882: path.go:65 - filepathlite.Clean

6891: path.go:130 - filepath.Join
   └─ Join joins any number of path elements into a single path, separating them with an OS specific [Separator]. Empty elements are ignored. The result is Cleaned. However, if the argument list is empty or all its elements are empty, Join returns an empty string. On Windows, the result will only be a UNC path if the first non-empty element is a UNC path.
6892: path_unix.go:32 - filepath.join
6893: path.go:161 - filepath.Abs
   └─ Abs returns an absolute representation of path. If the path is not absolute it will be joined with the current working directory to turn it into an absolute path. The absolute path name for a given file is not guaranteed to be unique. Abs calls [Clean] on the result.
6894: path_unix.go:28 - filepath.abs

6897: path_unix.go:35 - filepathlite.IsAbs
   └─ IsAbs reports whether the path is absolute.
6898: getwd.go:26 - os.Getwd
   └─ Getwd returns an absolute path name corresponding to the current directory. If the current directory can be reached via multiple paths (due to symbolic links), Getwd may return any one of them. On Unix platforms, if the environment variable PWD provides an absolute name, and it is a name of the current directory, it is returned.
6899: env.go:101 - os.Getenv
   └─ Getenv retrieves the value of the environment variable named by the key. It returns the value, which will be empty if the variable is not present. To distinguish between an empty value and an unset value, use [LookupEnv].
6900: log.go:50 - testlog.Getenv
   └─ Getenv calls Logger().Getenv, if a logger has been set.
6901: log.go:41 - testlog.Logger
   └─ Logger returns the current test logger implementation. It returns nil if there is no logger.
6902: stat_unix.go:29 - os.statNolog
   └─ statNolog stats a file with no test logging.
6903: file_posix.go:254 - os.ignoringEINTR
   └─ ignoringEINTR makes a function call and repeats it if it returns an EINTR error. This appears to be required even though we install all signal handlers with SA_RESTART: see #22838, #38033, #38836, #40846. Also #20400 and #36644 are issues in which a signal handler is installed without setting SA_RESTART. None of these are the common case, but there are enough of them that it seems that we can't avoid an EINTR loop.

   └─ Unix returns the time stored in ts as seconds plus nanoseconds.
6908: types.go:69 - os.SameFile
   └─ SameFile reports whether fi1 and fi2 describe the same file. For example, on Unix this means that the device and inode fields of the two underlying structures are identical; on other systems the decision may be based on the path names. SameFile only applies to results returned by this package's [Stat]. It returns false in other cases.

6914: fd_unix.go:55 - (*internal/poll.FD).Init
   └─ Init initializes the FD. The Sysfd field should already be set. This can be called multiple times on a single FD. The net argument is a network name from the net package (e.g., "tcp"), or "file". Set pollable to true if fd should be managed by runtime netpoll.

6919: exec_unix.go:105 - syscall.SetNonblock
6920: dir.go:69 - (*os.File).Readdirnames
   └─ Readdirnames reads the contents of the directory associated with file and returns a slice of up to n names of files in the directory, in directory order. Subsequent calls on the same file will yield further names. If n > 0, Readdirnames returns at most n names. In this case, if Readdirnames returns an empty slice, it will return a non-nil error explaining why. At the end of a directory, the error is [io.EOF]. If n <= 0, Readdirnames returns all the names from the directory in a single slice. In this case, if Readdirnames succeeds (reads all the way to the end of the directory), it returns the slice and a nil error. If it encounters an error before the end of the directory, Readdirnames returns the names read until that point and a non-nil error.
6921: dir_unix.go:47 - (*os.File).readdir
6922: fd_unixjs.go:52 - (*internal/poll.FD).ReadDirent

   └─ Type returns type bits in m (m & [ModeType]).
6936: error.go:90 - os.IsNotExist
   └─ IsNotExist returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is known to report that a file or directory does not exist. It is satisfied by [ErrNotExist] as well as some syscall errors. This function predates [errors.Is]. It only supports errors returned by the os package. New code should use errors.Is(err, fs.ErrNotExist).
6937: error.go:117 - os.underlyingErrorIs
6938: error.go:131 - os.underlyingError
   └─ underlyingError returns the underlying error for known os error types.

   └─ lstatNolog lstats a file with no test logging.
6940: stat_unix.go:15 - (*os.File).Stat
   └─ Stat returns the [FileInfo] structure describing file. If there is an error, it will be of type [*PathError].
6941: fd_unix.go:639 - (*internal/poll.FD).Fstat
   └─ Fstat wraps syscall.Fstat
6942: fd_posix.go:72 - poll.ignoringEINTR
   └─ ignoringEINTR makes a function call and repeats it if it returns an EINTR error. This appears to be required even though we install all signal handlers with SA_RESTART: see #22838, #38033, #38836, #40846. Also #20400 and #36644 are issues in which a signal handler is installed without setting SA_RESTART. None of these are the common case, but there are enough of them that it seems that we can't avoid an EINTR loop.
6943: path.go:184 - filepath.Rel
   └─ Rel returns a relative path that is lexically equivalent to targpath when joined to basepath with an intervening separator. That is, [Join](basepath, Rel(basepath, targpath)) is equivalent to targpath itself. On success, the returned path will always be relative to basepath, even if basepath and targpath share no elements. An error is returned if targpath can't be made relative to basepath or if knowing the current working directory would be necessary to compute it. Rel calls [Clean] on the result.
6944: path.go:473 - filepath.VolumeName
   └─ VolumeName returns leading volume name. Given "C:\foo\bar" it returns "C:" on Windows. Given "\\host\share\foo" it returns "\\host\share". On other platforms it returns "".
6945: path_unix.go:42 - filepath.sameWord
6946: path.go:272 - filepathlite.VolumeNameLen
   └─ VolumeNameLen returns the length of the leading volume name on Windows. It returns 0 elsewhere.
6947: file.go:389 - os.Open
   └─ Open opens the named file for reading. If successful, methods on the returned file can be used for reading; the associated file descriptor has mode [O_RDONLY]. If there is an error, it will be of type [*PathError].
6948: file.go:410 - os.OpenFile
   └─ OpenFile is the generalized open call; most users will use Open or Create instead. It opens the named file with specified flag ([O_RDONLY] etc.). If the file does not exist, and the [O_CREATE] flag is passed, it is created with mode perm (before umask); the containing directory must exist. If successful, methods on the returned File can be used for I/O. If there is an error, it will be of type [*PathError].
6949: log.go:57 - testlog.Open
   └─ Open calls Logger().Open, if a logger has been set.
6950: file_unix.go:245 - os.openFileNolog
   └─ openFileNolog is the Unix implementation of OpenFile. Changes here should be reflected in openDirAt and openDirNolog, if relevant.
6951: stat.go:11 - os.Stat
   └─ Stat returns a [FileInfo] describing the named file. If there is an error, it will be of type [*PathError].
6952: log.go:64 - testlog.Stat
   └─ Stat calls Logger().Stat, if a logger has been set.
6953: file.go:351 - os.setStickyBit
   └─ setStickyBit adds ModeSticky to the permission bits of path, non atomic.
6954: file.go:647 - os.Chmod
   └─ Chmod changes the mode of the named file to mode. If the file is a symbolic link, it changes the mode of the link's target. If there is an error, it will be of type [*PathError]. A different subset of the mode bits are used, depending on the operating system. On Unix, the mode's permission bits, [ModeSetuid], [ModeSetgid], and [ModeSticky] are used. On Windows, only the 0o200 bit (owner writable) of mode is used; it controls whether the file's read-only attribute is set or cleared. The other bits are currently unused. For compatibility with Go 1.12 and earlier, use a non-zero mode. Use mode 0o400 for a read-only file and 0o600 for a readable+writable file. On Plan 9, the mode's permission bits, [ModeAppend], [ModeExclusive], and [ModeTemporary] are used.

6965: precomputed_metric_streams.go:242 - executor.decompressAggregateStream
6966: decoder.go:87 - zstd.NewReader
   └─ NewReader creates a new decoder. A nil Reader can be provided in which case Reset can be used to start a decode. A Decoder can be used in two modes: 1) As a stream, or 2) For stateless decoding using DecodeAll. Only a single stream can be decoded concurrently, but the same decoder can run multiple concurrent stateless decodes. It is even possible to use stateless decodes while a stream is being decoded. The Reset function can be used to initiate a new stream, which will considerably reduce the allocations normally caused by NewReader.

7024: context.go:215 - context.Background
   └─ Background returns a non-nil, empty [Context]. It is never canceled, has no values, and has no deadline. It is typically used by the main function, initialization, and tests, and as the top-level Context for incoming requests.
7025: context.go:240 - context.WithCancel
   └─ WithCancel returns a derived context that points to the parent context but has a new Done channel. The returned context's Done channel is closed when the returned cancel function is called or when the parent context's Done channel is closed, whichever happens first. Canceling this context releases resources associated with it, so code should call cancel as soon as the operations running in this [Context] complete.
7026: context.go:273 - context.withCancel

7107: secondary_api.go:33 - errors.WithSecondaryError
   └─ WithSecondaryError enhances the error given as first argument with an annotation that carries the error given as second argument.  The second error does not participate in cause analysis (Is, etc) and is only revealed when printing out the error or collecting safe (PII-free) details for reporting. If additionalErr is nil, the first error is returned as-is. Tip: consider using CombineErrors() below in the general case. Detail is shown: - via `errors.GetSafeDetails()`, shows details from secondary error. - when formatting with `%+v`. - in Sentry reports.
7108: strings.go:285 - strings.LastIndexByte

   └─ WithDetail decorates an error with a textual detail. The detail may contain PII and thus will not reportable. Detail is shown: - when formatting with `%+v`. - with `GetAllHints()` / `FlattenHints()` below. Note: the detail does not appear in the main error message returned with Error(). Use GetAllDetails() or FlattenDetails() to retrieve it.
7112: hintdetail.go:108 - hintdetail.WithDetail
   └─ WithDetail decorates an error with a textual detail. The detail may contain PII and thus will not reportable. Detail is shown: - when formatting with `%+v`. - with `GetAllHints()` / `FlattenHints()` below. Note: the detail does not appear in the main error message returned with Error().

Use GetAllHints() or FlattenHints() to retrieve it.
7118: hintdetail.go:33 - hintdetail.WithHint
   └─ WithHint decorates an error with a textual hint. The hint may contain PII and thus will not reportable. Hint is shown: - when formatting with `%+v`. - with `GetAllHints()` / `FlattenHints()` below. Note: the hint does not appear in the main error message returned with Error(). Use GetAllHints() or FlattenHints() to retrieve it.
7119: lexer.go:239 - (*github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser/pkg/sql/parser.lexer).SetHelp
   └─ SetHelp marks the "last error" field in the lexer to become a help text. This method is invoked in the error action of the parser, so the help text is only produced if the last token encountered was HELPTOKEN -- other cases are just syntax errors, and in that case we do not want the help text to overwrite the lastError field, which was set earlier to contain details about the syntax error.

   └─ CoalesceBlocks groups adjacent blocks into larger reads to reduce IO operations. Uses aggressive coalescing by default to minimize IOs for S3/object storage. For backward compatibility, maxReadSize parameter is still accepted. For S3 workloads: fewer IOs is more important than bandwidth savings (use aggressive). For bandwidth-constrained scenarios: use CoalesceBlocksWithConfig with DefaultCoalesceConfig.
7443: reader.go:909 - blockio.AggressiveCoalesceConfig
   └─ AggressiveCoalesceConfig returns config that minimizes IO operations for S3/object storage. This is the recommended default since S3 latency (~20ms/IO) dominates over bandwidth costs. Trades bandwidth efficiency for fewer round-trips.

This is critical for object storage (S3) where each IO operation has ~20ms latency. Adaptive coalescing skips large gaps to avoid reading excessive unwanted data: - Adjacent blocks (gap=0) are always coalesced - Small gaps (< MaxGapSize) are coalesced if waste ratio is acceptable - Large gaps cause separate reads Example: blocks [10, 50, 51, 90] - Aggressive: reads 10-90 (huge waste reading 11-49, 52-89) - Adaptive: reads [10], [50-51], [90] (3 IOs, no waste)
7445: reader.go:1034 - (*github.com/mattdurham/blockpack/internal/blockio.Reader).ReadCoalescedBlocks
   └─ ReadCoalescedBlocks reads a single coalesced chunk and returns individual block bytes. Returns a map of blockIdx -> rawBytes for each block in the coalesced read. Caching strategy: 1. First checks cache for individual blocks (file:offset:length keys) 2. For cache misses, reads the entire coalesced chunk in one I/O 3. Caches both the coalesced chunk AND individual blocks within it This enables future queries needing just one block to hit cache instead of re-reading. Expected impact: 30-50% better cache hit rate for queries with overlapping block access.
